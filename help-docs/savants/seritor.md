Well done, you have escaped the shackles of Thralldom and may tackle the
true challenges which lie ahead. Thus begins an earnest study of Chaos
and the deities associated with it. You will also further expand your
knowledge of ritualism and experimentation, the tools by which we bend
this flawed Creation to our will.



The Divine:

Familiarise yourself with the Divine associated with Chaos (as listed in
HHELP CHAOS) and be prepared to discuss in depth the realm of at least
one of Them. You may discuss your findings as part of your interview,
present them in written form, or even lead a discussion among a group of
your peers.

**An elder member of the House must verify any independent discussion
you choose to lead by sending a message to the Head of Newcomers.**

Suggested reading:
- A primer of Chaos (located in the estate library)
- HHELP CHAOS
- HELP DIVINE

Ritual and Experimentation:

Ritual and experimentation are integral to the study of the Savants.

Visit the Nicator Archives, the chapel of Lord Babel, and the house
estate where you will be able to check out various texts about ritualism
and experimentation. Using what you learn, refine the experiment you
devised in your last set of tasks.

Suggested reading, available in the Nicator Archives:
- Rituals of Ruin
- The Key of Iron and Gold
- The personal diary of Wattley Castaigne
- Transmogrification

**Note: You may gain credit for this task by participating in the
experiment/ritual of a Housemate. You will still be required to
demonstrate an understanding of this experience.**

Contact the Magister of Bedlam or an aide to advance to Aberrant.
