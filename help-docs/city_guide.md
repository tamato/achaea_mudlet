These chosen newbie helpers can earn up to 12 of their daily credits by being
"on duty" at a rate of 300 renown per hour.

You can be on duty for as long as you like, but you will only earn renown
for your first 4 hours on duty each day.
 
- Being on duty separates their names for easy recognition.
- On duty city guide CWHO highlights all sub level 60 characters and
characters under age 21.

skills up to transcendent.

Admin Note:
-----------
On duty city guides should be paying attention.
You can be hunting, questing, or doing other things, you do not have to sit
in one static location.

On duty city guides who go afk, who ignore requests for assistance, or who
otherwise abuse the position for other spurious means may find themselves
banned from city guide status, mentorship, and worse.

All interaction when "on duty" should be appropriate for Achaea's PG13
environment.
