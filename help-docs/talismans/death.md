in said area). Can only be used once every 2 hours.

## gravestone
TALISMAN INFO Deathcape

You may plant this gravestone in a location and you shall resurrect in that spot after
EMBRACEing death, rather than at the usual place. Be warned, anyone may DESPOIL your gravestone, 
rendering it inactive until rePLANTed.

## deathcandle
TALISMAN INFO Deathcape

The owner of this candle will be able to get an idea of how long a denizen has been alive for
when CONSIDERing.

## crucible
TALISMAN INFO Deathcape

This crucible may be lit in a room, and shall then damage all present whenever deathsight
occurs within the area the crucible is placed.

## mortalcoil
TALISMAN INFO Deathcape

The one to BREAK this coil shall die shortly after.
