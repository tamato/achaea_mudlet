As the Seat of Chaos, we are called TO MAKE WAR. Perpetuation of
conflict is one of the main ways we usher Chaos into this realm in
fulfillment of the Ruinous Accords.

Ashtan's army is the first line of defense for the city as well as the
Seat's primary offensive force. There are no formal requirements for
enlistment; however, those interested in joining the ranks of our
military should make the effort to graduate the Institute of Entropy
before requesting conscription.

When you join the army, you are required to serve a minimum term of two
years. There is no way around this.


If you wish to join the ranks of Ashtan's army, it is recommended that
you:

1. Obtain a complete array of elixirs, salves, and herbs.
2. Be prepared to follow orders
3. Possess a willingness to better yourself as a combatant and
   member of a fighting unit.

Questions about basic training, joining raids, and promotions may be
directed to the Minister of Defence.
