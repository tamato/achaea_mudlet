Each year you should endeavor to do the following.
Aides that fall short are not meeting the mark or are not
in the realm enough to fulfill their duties for two consecutive years
will be dismissed from their position:

It is our duty to interact with newcomers in a meaningful
manner in order to help them feel welcome and at ease
in their new life in Ashtan.

1. Look at CITYNEWBIES or CITY NOVICE LIST regularly, as well as
check AMBLOG ASHTAN and READLOG AAC.

Introduce yourself to any newcomers and induct them into the Academy.
CLHELP INDUCTION

Let them know they can look at AIDES AMBASSADOR and approach any
of us if they have questions or need of assistance.

2. Writelog aac any interactions you have with newcomers.

3. Give Academy testing when a newcomer asks for one.

4. Send an introduction letter or message to at least
one newcomer each year. The suggested format for this
can be found in CLANHELP LETTERS or CLANHELP MESSAGES,
but feel free to be creative and have fun with it!

5. Identify those who have returned from a long slumber
and help them acclimate themselves to our new way of life.
Tips on doing so can be found in CLANHELP RETURNED.

6. Citizen approved applicants as the process outlined in
CLANHELP HOWTOCITIZEN. Please note: Process is important here!
Failure to adhere to it may result in your removal as an aide.

7. Try to hold an event for our city newcomers at least once
per year. Upon doing so, send a report to the current
Ambassador via letter. This is an important duty and should
not be overlooked!

You must report on your annual activity. Use the
WRITELOG feature of the clan to chronicle your interactions
with city newcomers each month. Not doing so triggers the
need for you to report on why you've been unable to fulfill
your duties (CLANHELP REPORTS).
