Summary:
ALL APPLICANTS are expected to be familiar with the Laws and House
Rights of Ashtan, resolve any enemy statuses accordingly, and be without
citizenship of a city before submitting an application in addition to
maintaining that status for the duration of the application process.

The Laws and House Rights are inscribed upon the Standards of Ambition,
directly northwards of our main gates. You will need to PUSH, PULL, and
TURN the PLINTH to fully read everything inscribed.
HELP ASHTAN will list the Archon Ascendant, the Archons, the Minister of
Security, the Ambassador and those able to induct new citizens.

Enemy statuses to be resolved
--------------------------------
Be at least on neutral terms with Ashtan, all Ashtani Houses and the
Court of Chaos.

Submitting an application
--------------------------------
Depending on your age, you shall have to send a message (NOT a letter)
to the current Ambassador. Include in this application the following:
- Your current class and the Ashtani House you will be seeking.
- All previous cities you have belonged to, stating when and why you
left your most recent city.
- Any wrongdoings against Ashtan or her allies.
- The reason(s) you wish to become Ashtani.

Applicants aged 20 or under
--------------------------------
It is very likely you will be able to join through Epicurus, Master of
the Garden. When in Ashtan, simply WALK TO EPICURUS to find him, and ASK
EPICURUS JOIN ASHTAN. If the above process is not possible for you,
please follow the procedure for those under the age of 33.

Applicants aged 21-32
--------------------------------
You will need to gain the approval of the Ambassador or one (1) Archon.

Applicants aged 33 upwards
--------------------------------
Gain approval from the Ambassador and at least TWO (2) out of five (5)
Archons or from THREE (3) Archons.

What happens next
--------------------------------
When you are approved, the Ambassador will message you noting the
approval and induction date, with some additional intructions.

It is your responsibility to send your application via MSG to the
Ambassador, at which time (s)he will make it available to the Archons
for review.

You will have two Achaean years to become an Ashtani citizen. You may
contact the Ambassador or one of their aides to help you do so.

NOTE: From the moment an application is posted, three months time is
alloted for Archons to review the application and note their approval.
You will not be able to be inducted before the conclusion of this three
month period.
