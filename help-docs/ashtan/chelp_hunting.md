This scroll was composed by Llyweith many, many years ago. Its contents
may be somewhat outdated, but it still provides a general guide to
different hunting grounds located throughout Achaea.

AREAS offers another option for this that is suitable to your specific
level in the realm. Whichever guide you follow, always CONSIDER and
PROBE a potential target in an unknown location before you attack.
Killing a loyal companion of another adventurer or city gives them cause
to seek revenge on you (HELP PK for more information).
