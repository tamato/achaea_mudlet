This scroll was shared by the Vanguard house to help those needing
guidance in getting started in their classes for basic 1v1 combat.

---General Knowledge---
--------------------------------

The following skills, except for selfishness in survival, should be
learned after you become transcendent in your main class skills. Some
exceptions, such as when to learn weaponry, may apply and should be
discussed with your mentor or other high-ranking house member.

Survival - As the name suggests, the abilities in survival deal mostly
with the outdoors (swimming) and general healing (restoration).
Selfishness is recommended early on in your studies to prevent theft.
These skills are useful for both combat and hunting. HELP SURVIVAL

Tattoos - Tattoos are very helpful in both combat and hunting. Although
another adventurer can ink for you, there is an added benefit of being
able to hold double the number of tattoos if you transcend this skill.
HELP TATTOOS

Avoidance - This mini-skill enables you to train your body to avoid
physical attacks and reduce damage from cutting and blunt attacks. It
works against both adventurers and denizens. HELP AVOIDANCE

Weaponry - You may use any weapon you wish via this skillset, though it
is recommended you use the weapon appropriate to your class. Training in
weaponry also increases the effectiveness of certain class skills, such
as weaponmastery, pranks, or two arts. These skills are combat-oriented.
HELP WEAPONRY

Riding - The abilities in riding are heavily combat-oriented and should
be learned after some of the more important skills above are acquired.
HELP RIDING

-Occultist---
--------------------------------

Must haves:
Selfishness in Survival
Squint in Vision
 
Hunting and combat both will center around Occultism and is your primary
skill for the future. Tarot and Domination are utility and
Combat. Early skills in Tarot potentially worth getting are Fool and
Priestess. Trait suggestion is Quick Witted, focusing on Intelligence
path.

You have two main kill routes to choose from, enlighten and truename.

-- Enlighten Path
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To achieve enlighten, you will need to instill + bloodleech until you
stick 3 physical affs and then stick cadmus. Once you have cadmus, moon
(targetted or untargetted + devil) and either storm or humbug or
bloodleech until 5 affs are stacked. Stick hecate and madness, then add
more moons with storm or humbug until there are enough mental affs to
enlighten and unravel.

bloodleech              - haemophilia, thins blood, prime increases bleed
instill                 - afflictions of the body
humbug                  - addiction, prime drain hp and mana, eat ginseng
moon (use with devil)   - mental afflictions
cadmus                  - asthma, then slick, prime maladies of the mind
storm                   - vertigo
hecate                  - withered limbs
madness                 - longer focus
enlighten               - locks them
unravel                 - finisher

-- Truename
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Truename uses enervate + hound to pressure health and mana together to
attempt to get them down to 40% mana. Hit with cleansaura and use
abomination to harvest truenames. You can harvest up to 3 truenames via
this mechanic which is usually enough to kill someone. Truename will do
40-50% damage and give aeon thru speed. The aeon makes it hard for your
target to escape, potentially allowing you to hit with all three and
secure the kill. Using tents will increase your chances of hindering
them long enough. The mind warden trait is useful for this path.
