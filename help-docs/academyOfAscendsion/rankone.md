RANK ONE

Chaos is a part of your being, and like any other inherent trait, it is
capable of being developed. You possess infinite potential. In this rank
of the Academy, we aim to help guide you towards your initial
manifestations of it.

Concept of Self:

|x| While we all walk the path of Enlightenment, our first steps are
often unique and shaped by our history. Be prepared to discuss your life
before your experiences with the pygmies and your citizenship to Ashtan.
Your memories may be a bit hazy following your escape. This is perfectly
reasonable, in which case, simply be willing to speak a little about
yourself.

|x| Ensure you have a suitable description so citizens can get a good
LOOK at you. Remember, you represent our city at all times.
Additionally, make use of DIRECTORY and CHELP SHOPS in order to find
appropriate clothing and out of those rags. HELP DESCRIPTION and HELP
EMOTING are both useful guides to better help you express your unique
self.
