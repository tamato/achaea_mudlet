Ashtan's laws (Ashtan Law 7 - House Provisions) states that:

- All citizens of Ashtan shall be members of one of our three Houses.

- All members of our three Houses shall be citizens of Ashtan.

- Citizens can petition the Archonate to be exempt from this law.
Decisions will be made on a per person basis. This right can be
rescinded at any time through majority Archonate vote.

What this means is you must join a House based in Ashtan. The law is
intended to unify our citizens around our common ethos and ensure
continued effort toward our common goal of furthering Chaos, so we may
usher forth a new era of its Dominion that will lead to our Ascension.
In order to be exempt, you must petition the Archonate and be able to
adequately display your usefulness and ability to further our aims
without doing so in a House.

HOUSE LIST ASHTAN will show you the names of Ashtan's current Houses.

HELP HOUSE <HOUSENAME> will offer a bit more detail on each one. In
addition, the Academy of Ascension has one room dedicated to each House.
You are encouraged to explore the building and learn even more about our
ruinous organizations.

It is recommended, but not required, that you speak with an elder (HR5+
member who is qualified to be a mentor) from the House of your choice to
learn more about the organization from someone with experience.

Should you decide the House you decided on is no longer the best choice,
you will be able to QUIT <HOUSE> and join any of the other two without
any difficulty. It is advised that you say some goodbyes to the elders
of that House before you do so, especially if they've spent a great deal
of time preparing you for the ruin you'll undoubtedly wreak in another
organization!
