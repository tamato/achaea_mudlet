In the beginning there was nothing. From this nothing Ayar brought forth
both Chaos and Creation, and though it is said that He intended for them
to be separate, the events following the rape of Aldar Maya by the
Unnameable brought forth the first changes upon Creation without the
influence of the Gods. Ever since, Chaos has influenced this world in
countless ways, never again allowing Creation to slip into an endless
stagnancy.

To put it simply, Chaos is a force of potential upon Creation. Opposite
of stagnancy, the influence of Chaos alters everything it touches in
ways that are often beyond mortal comprehension and are entirely
unpredictable in nature. Though the ramifications of these changes are
often misconstrued as either good or bad, such mortal lenses are the
inherent result of Order, and thus we come to understand that Chaos is
neither positive nor negative. It simply is.

Through your studies, you'll learn more about the Workings of Chaos and
how we utilize these teachings in order to usher in the new Dominion and
Ascend as Lords and Ladies of the Court of Chaos.
