     benefits.
   - The effects that the chocolates can provide range from experience boosts,
     increased stats, critical hit bonuses, faster movement, increased

        Level 20: Immortality will no longer kill you, should you reach your
                  full health and mana before immortality fades.

 ** Note **
It's not true "immortality", more of a slight postponement of the inevitable.
Here's what happens with the immortality power active:
   1. You receive a non-instakill attack that brings you to 0 health.
   2. The ability fires, giving you and people in the room a message that it
      fires.
   3. Your health is set to a very low level, any afflictions and effects on
      your person remain.
   4. You continue the fight as normal until either:
      a) Receive an attack that brings you to 0 health again.
      b) You get instakilled.
      c) The immortality power fails.
       d) You heal up to full health/mana (with a level 20 locket only).
   * Being killed in the immortal timeframe will kill the victim normally.
   * Immortality will bypass any SOULCAGE (Necromancy) or TRANSMOGRIFY
     (Occultism)  defences that you have when it activates.
   * Immortality will not work in the arena.

Currently viable items are: Rings, bracelets, boots, belts, pendants, armour (not morphing), wings,
shields, and earrings. If you have a resetting item that can be interacted with by any of these 
terms, then the mud will alter its description!

Golden Giftbags
    - These special giftbags are different to the standard kind in that
      they can be upgraded!
    - Each bag starts at tier 0 (see below for the full prize lists).
    - GIFTBAG UPGRADE <bag> will attempt to upgrade your giftbag's contents
      to the next level of prizes. Be warned, however, that there is only a
      -chance- that your attempt will succeed. Higher level giftbags have a
      progressively lower chance of success.
    - If you are unsuccessful in upgrading your giftbag, its contents will be
      replaced with ONE item (or group of items) from the default tier. So if
      your bag is already at the default tier and you are unsuccessful in
      upgrading, rather than a group of 20 sileris, 10 key sigils, a group of
      25 red inks, and 1000 gold... you might get a group of 20 bloodroot. So
      there is a risk of not getting much... but you will always get
      something!
   -  Each bag can be upgraded multiple times, though remember, the chance of
      success goes down the higher a bag gets! If an upgrade is successful,
      congratulations! Your giftbag's contents will be replaced with an item
      from the next higher tier. Once removed from the giftbag, artefacts
      that can normally be traded in may be traded in.
   - The tiers:

      0 - Default level at which all giftbags start: you'll get some herbs,
      sigils, inks, and gold.

      1 - Runic vials containing stat, experience, and critical hit boosting
      elixirs, or clay chips (worth 20cr to trade-in).

      2 - Artefact pipe, Artefact vial, or ivory dice.

      3 - Dragonskin quiver, drinking horn, Dagger of Reincarnation, or
      Serpentine Keyring.

      4 - One of the level 1 artefact weapons.

      5 - Wand of Reflections, Eagle's wings, Buckawn Amulet, or Wand of
      Portals.

      Adaptation, or Girdle of Aegis.

   - GIFTBAG CHECK <bag>   - Check whether or not a giftbag can be upgraded,
     and what the next tier prizes are.

Magical love arrows
   - These arrows can be used to SHOOT <player> WITH LOVE and mark yourself
     as a future recipient of a gift from Eros.
   - PROMO_ARROWS: This command shows you how many arrows you have, and how
     many you have shot.

Paper lanterns
Paper lanterns are a new consumeable item created to help celebrate Nissa's grand cultural showcase!
When you open a globe and get a lantern, the lantern will theme to your city!

If you do not have a city you will also get a themed lantern, no fear!

These lanterns can be lit, and they will fly up into the air to disappear and convey one of three
gifts to the city as a whole! This will be either 5 credits in the city's coffers, a 15 minute 
critical hit bonus, or a 15 minute xp bonus!

If you are a rogue lighting a lantern the bonuses are the critical hit bonus or the XP bonus, rogue
lanterns do not offer organisation credits.

Lighting more lanterns will extend the duration of the crit or XP bonuses, up as far as the end of
July when the celebration, any lanterns, and any bonuses (regardless of duration remaining), will 
come to an end.

Alongside these promotional items, unique and special artefacts are also sold
in the Shop of Wonders (HELP SOW) on the isle of Delos.
