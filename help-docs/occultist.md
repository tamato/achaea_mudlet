Enlighten
----------------
Reveal the truth to the uninitiated.

Syntax: ENLIGHTEN <target>
Required:   2% karma
Works against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:   4.00 seconds of equilibrium
Details:    Perhaps the cruelest curse imaginable, you can reveal the occult mysteries to a non-initiate as you have learned it. Their minds must be sufficiently open for the revelation to be received. In other words, they must have five(*) of: 

- claustrophobia 
- agoraphobia 
- lovers 
- dementia
- epilepsy 
- hallucinations 
- confusion 
- stupidity 
- paranoia 
- vertigo 
- shyness 
- addiction 
- recklessness 
- masochism.

If such is the case, you may give that target the revelation of what the nature of the universe is as you see it, which will unfortunately make their insanities permanent until death.

* This number drops to four if they are suffering from the curse of whispering madness.
