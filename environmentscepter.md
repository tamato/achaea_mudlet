   19.10.24 < House of Wonders              Alchemist Artefacts > 19.10.26

The lavishly bejewelled sceptre, also known as the Sceptre of Environments,
is a unique artefact that begins as a simple trophy but can be embellished
with further gemstones to confer numerous bonuses upon its owner when they
stand within certain environments.
 
 
SCEPTRE FORM <attuned gem> - When you are in possession of your first attuned
                             gem, this will form your sceptre.
                             The gem will be consumed and added to the gem
                             repertoire for that gem's attuned environment.
 
SCEPTRE UNATTUNE <gem>     - Gems for the sceptre are attuned by default to a
                             specific environment: Desert, Beach, Forest, etc.
                             This command will remove the attunement.
 
SCEPTRE INSERT <gem> [env] - Insert a gem into your sceptre.
                             This is irreversible.
                             Attuned gems automatically add to their specified
                             environmental repertoire and unlock powers at
                             certain thresholds.
                             If using an unattuned gem, the environment of your
                             choice must be specified.
                             The first gem for any environment must be attuned.
                             Subsequent gems need not be.
