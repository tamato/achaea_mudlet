                                "
Alashi tells you, "What sort of things were you thinking of selling?"
You tell Alashi, "Honestly, it was more for the experience of discovering 
what it's like."

You tell Alashi, "If that is not the "best" reason, it won't offend me to not 
have me on the list."
You tell Alashi, "At this time."

Alashi tells you, "A commendable ambition. I'll say that curatives sell out 
the fastest, and I suspect certain enchanted items and sigils would as well."
You tell Alashi, "Apologies, but going to fork the conversation for a moment. 
I'm not at all familir with enchantments. Is that something worth taking some 
time on?"

Alashi tells you, "The next year we have leases up is 940, though it's not 
unlikely that something will open up before then."
Alashi tells you, "Ah, by enchantments I mean the augmentation tradeskill."

You tell Alashi, "Oo that does sound interesting. What is that?"


Alashi tells you, "Essentially you enchant scrolls with powers like water 
walking, elemental resistance, firelash, and the like. Then people who buy 
the scrolls can apply them to their items."
Alashi tells you, "It's something the Ashtani market is in dire need of. So 
if you do decide to take it up, it would be an excellent thing to stock in a 
shop. If not your own, I'd be happy to stock it in World's End on consignment.
"

You tell Alashi, "That sounds fantastic. Is there anything else Ashtan could 
use more of? I am rather single minded, in that I hunt too much."
You tell Alashi, "I want to help the city, and really need to broaden my 
horizon's."

Alashi tells you, "Sigils and other items created with the Conjuration 
tradeskill as well. And we have quite a lot of minerals on the market, but 
very few herbs. So Harvesting wouldn't be a bad choice of skills either."
You tell Alashi, "Is havesting a tradeskill?"

Alashi tells you, "I'll say that augmentation and conjuration involve a 
rather obnoxious crafting process, but I believe there are people who can 
help you train your reflexes for them."


Alashi tells you, "It is."
Alashi tells you, "And your desire to serve the Empire is appreciated. If you 
are looking for ways to do that, most Ministries are likely recruiting aides."
Alashi impishly tells you, "I've also been meaning to reach out to you about 
House tasks, but I don't want to overwhelm you at the moment."
You tell Alashi, "Where can I find a list of Ministries?"
You tell Alashi, "No please, I do need to graduate from being a Thrall. But a 
list like that might push me in the right direction."


Alashi tells you, "Hm, I'm not sure that we have an easily accessible list. 
But I'll gladly speak on them, if you'd like!"
You tell Alashi, "I believe I got a solid idea for my experiments, but 
dwandling on picking a choas lord for performing a rite."
Alashi tells you, "You can at least see a list of all current Ministers with 
HELP ASHTAN. The Ambassador, Interior, Culture, Defence, and the Navy."
Alashi tells you, "Technically Treasurer as well, but I don't believe that 
position takes aides."
You tell Alashi, "I would like to join the Institue of Entropy, but the is 
really the only one I'm aware. If it is even a ministry."
Alashi tells you, "The Institute is a clan with resources for new combatants. 
I can't induct you myself, but let me see if someone else can."
Alashi tells you, "Hm. No one right now, apparently. I'd ask over CT or the 
Academy channel when more people are around."
You tell Alashi, "I've been meaning too. but my time has been limited. I'll 
send some folks a msgs to queue that up."
Alashi tells you, "Aye, it can be difficult depending on your waking time. I 
really need to work on getting the status to induct people myself."
