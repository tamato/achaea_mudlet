Truename
------------------

start off with instill/paralysis then nin'kharsag.
This would trigger themt to cure paralysis first and we want Asthma to stick on them.
Since it is possible they'll use Tree, hit them a second time.

Constent use of nin'kharsag will start to paralyiz if asthma was not cured.
Asthma is cured with Kelp, para is Bloodroot.

With asthma on them, to keep it on keep using nin'kharsag to re-apply it.
That thing will keep the ent timer busy. For main Eq, use Aeon Tarot.
Don't use devil, because it probably uses up Entity balance. Need to confirm that though.

After hitting with Aeon, switch to hanged man with Rixil. If they are still hindered, then Lovers

Start again.

Ague, Aeon ramblings, Apply
--------------------------------------
Mending uses salve balance
**Aeon** is cured with smoking, asthma by eating
- BUT the speed defence is applied with **SIP** Speed
- If their mana or health is low enough, then that might block Sipping speed.
- Set up a trigger to watch for sipping.
- once they are hit with Aeon, apply **Asthma**
 - ways to get asthma:
 - instil asthma, cadmus (non primed)
 - if still aeon'd and asthma, then hit with Nin'kharsag, and web them
- Triggers for finding which pipe they use for curing asthma
- Triggers for finding which pipe they use for curing disfigurement/mana leech
- Triggers for finding which pipe they use for giving weapon rebound
- Marduk, put *all* pipe in pack? maybe just one at a time.
- put flame sigil on pipe? knock them prone and do it, they might be able to do this while prone.

**Ague** blocked and cured with Caloric, Apply
- this is shared with Mending
- set up triggers for Ague and Hecate/Shrivel
 - Which is cured first, apply to limbs(mending) or to body(caloric)?
