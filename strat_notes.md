Truename
------------------

start off with instill/paralysis then nin'kharsag.
This would trigger themt to cure paralysis first and we want Asthma to stick on them.
Since it is possible they'll use Tree, hit them a second time.

Constent use of nin'kharsag will start to paralyiz if asthma was not cured.
Asthma is cured with Kelp, para is Bloodroot.

With asthma on them, to keep it on keep using nin'kharsag to re-apply it.
That thing will keep the ent timer busy. For main Eq, use Aeon Tarot.
Don't use devil, because it probably uses up Entity balance. Need to confirm that though.

After hitting with Aeon, switch to hanged man with Rixil. If they are still hindered, then Lovers

Start again.
