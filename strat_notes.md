Truename
------------------

start off with instill/paralysis then nin'kharsag.
This would trigger themt to cure paralysis first and we want Asthma to stick on them.
Since it is possible they'll use Tree, hit them a second time.

Constent use of nin'kharsag will start to paralyiz if asthma was not cured.
Asthma is cured with Kelp, para is Bloodroot.

With asthma on them, to keep it on keep using nin'kharsag to re-apply it.
That thing will keep the ent timer busy. For main Eq, use Aeon Tarot.
Don't use devil, because it probably uses up Entity balance. Need to confirm that though.

After hitting with Aeon, switch to hanged man with Rixil. If they are still hindered, then Lovers

Start again.

You shuffle a tarot card inscribed with the Wheel of Fortune out of your deck, bringing the total
number of remaining cards to 18.
Orange lightning sparks between your fingers as you unleash the broken wheel to turn its requiem for
the damned.

The Broken Wheel shall turn 7 rotations before chaos shall reign.

- a little less then 3 seconds
You have recovered equilibrium.

- 7 more seconds
Vibrant indigo rays of light lash out from the Wheel of Chaos.

The Wheel of Chaos winks out of existence.
