Domination is without question the most dangerous art within Achaea. It
involves the summoning of entities from the Chaos Plane as well as Chaos Lords.
You risk your life and your very soul in dealing with them, for they are
powerful and not to be trifled with.

To gain the services of a Chaos Entity, you must first discover a way into the
Chaos Plane. Once there, search them out and DOMINATE <entity>. If the entity
feels you are wasting its time, it may choose to attack you or it may simply
ignore you. However, if it feels it can gain something, it will begin a
bargaining dialogue with you, asking how you intend to pay it for its services.
Answer the questions as you like, but be warned that cheapness can have its own
punishment. At any time during the bargaining, you may ABORT to end the
dialogue. The entity may grow enraged at this, however, or may simply refuse to
bargain further with you.

After you have finished your bargaining, you will see, if you type PACTS, what
pacts you have made with entities. If you have a pact made, you may call upon
the aid of that entity by doing SUMMON <entity>. In some cases, the entity
itself will come, and in some cases it will send its minions to assist you.

When an entity is summoned, it will, in most cases, remain in the land for a
full day. There are, however, ways to send it back to its infernal realm
prematurely. BANISH <entity> will accomplish this if it is your wish, while
others may have abilities that allow them to drive the entity off. An entity
cannot be killed (though an entity's minions can be). It will only be driven
back to the Chaos Plane if it falls into a state that would kill a mortal.

Summary of general Domination-related commands:

DOMINATE <entity>          : Begin to dominate a chaos entity.
ABORT                      : Abort negotiations with the entity.
PACTS                      : See what pacts you have with entities.
PACT CANCEL <entity>       : Cancel a pact with an entity.
SUMMON <entity>            : Summon an entity or one of its servants. (*), 3 eq
SUMMON <list of entities>  : Summon multiple entities at once. (*)
                           : 3 second EQ for each
BANISH <entity>            : Banish an entity back to the plane of Chaos.
CALL ENTITIES              : Call your loyal entities to you.
CALL ENTITIES PASSIVE      : Call your loyal entities to you in passive
form.


DOMINATE <entity>          : Begin to dominate a chaos entity.
* declare karma / wealth
* mean neutral GENEROUS

* You may prepend/append SWIFT to a single or list of entities to summon. This summons them with a karma cost instead of an equilibrium cost (for each entity).

Certain entities cannot be summoned in this way: GOLGOTHA, XENOPHAGE, PIRIDON, and ISTRIA. Entities summoned in this way will not attack passively for ten seconds, though may still be commanded to attack actively.

you will recover faster from this ability.

When primebonded, the gremlin shall race around the legs of your target,
inspiring dizziness in them; if they are already dizzy, it shall knock
them off balance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

it shall thin the blood of your foe, causing them to suffer from
haemophilia.

When primebonded, the leech shall coax out the blood of your foe, making

Cooldown:          3.00 seconds of entity balance
Resource:          50 mana

have the power to convert the afflictions your enemies labour into other
conditions:

- Whisperingmadness becomes recklessness.

When primebonded, the firelords will strike down those in your location
and adjacent ones with Pyradius' fire, burning them and setting them
ablaze.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax:            SUMMON GOLGOTHA
Cooldown:          2.40 seconds of equilibrium
Details:
Though a mere shadow of his former glory, Golgotha will pact with
occultists. He will grant a protection from attempts to magically banish
your chaotic servants back to the Chaos Plane, though it will only aid
you when you are in the same location as the targeted entities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Dameron (Domination)                          Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            COMMAND MINION AT <target>
Details:
Jy'Barrak Dameron is the right hand of the infernal throne. The minion
he shall send to aide you can be commanded to unravel the very mind of
your target, slaying them instantly(*).

The minions of Dameron gain no benefit from being primebonded, though
when one is present it will protect all of your other minions from being
banished from the prime.
* They must be enlightened, as with unravel via the occultism skill.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Palpatar (Domination)                         Known: Yes

When primebonded, the worm shall burrow into your target's belly, making
them violently ill periodically(**).

* Gives healthleech on a tick.
** Gives nausea.

Resource:          50 mana
Details:
Summoning the Slime Lord will cause a chaos slime to be sent to you.

When COMMANDed, it will envelop your victim and cause their next tree
tattoo attempt to take longer to recover from. If they have asthma, they
will also be paralysed; inhaling the Slime Lord's
spawn is never good for one's health.

When primebonded, the slime shall periodically damage your target; the
amount of damage inflicted is increased if they are suffering from
healthleech.

-- when slime is done
Irimon finally rids himself of the slime covering him
kaelthas ate - magnesium then aurum

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Marduk (Domination)                           Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            ORDER SOULMASTER POSSESS <target>
                   ORDER <target> <command>
                   - eat time with eat commands?
                   - force generosity
                   - apply a salve
                   - smoke a pipe

                   - do they have a heal command, to heal me with?

Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          3.00 seconds of equilibrium 
                    (3 sec to summon)
                    (3.00 to possess?)
                    (then it has its own cooldown)
                

Details:
Marduk will send to you a soulmaster entity. This entity may be ordered
to POSSESS an adventurer. When it does, it will take a few seconds to
gain control of the victim's mind. Once it has done this, you may ORDER
<target> <command>. Doing this is quite difficult for the soulmaster
though, so you will be restricted to doing it once every few seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Primebond (Domination)                        Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            PRIMEBOND
                   PRIMEBOND FORM <chaos lord>
                   PRIMEBOND SEVER <chaos lord>
Details:
The minions the Chaos Court will send to you are limited in their agency
given the constraints they labour under. No matter. A skilled user of
Domination will find they are able to forge bonds with the various Chaos
Lord's upon the Chaos Plane, and by doing so grant the minions those
Lords will send greater freedom when summoned(*).

You may only support up to four bonds at a time, so choose wisely. Bonds
may only be forged in the presence of the Lord you seek to bond with;
they may be severed from anywhere.

* Entities benefitting from a prime bond will act passively in addition
to retaining their active effects. See the ability files for relevant
details for each entity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nemesis (Domination)                          Known: Yes

Details:
When you call upon Lord Nemesis he shall send to you a humbug, which

addiction in them.

suffering from said insatiable addiction, it shall also drain some mana
as well as additional health.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Buul (Domination)                             Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            COMMAND CHIMERA AT <target>
                   MOUNT CHIMERA
                   SPUR CHIMERA SKYWARD
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          2.50 seconds of entity balance
Resource:          50 mana
Details:
When you call upon Buul he shall send to you a chimera, which you may
ride, and when commanded at a foe will deliver a most terrifying roar.
If your target is not deaf, they shall suffer an affliction of the mind.

When primebonded, the chimera shall periodically strike out with one of
its heads at a target, causing one of the following effects:
- A roar which will cure a target's deafness if such is present, or
knock them prone with a stun if it is not.
- A headbutt which will knock your foe prone.
- An insidious blast of breath which shall inspire sleep in your enemy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cadmus (Domination)                           Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            COMMAND BUBONIS AT <target>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          2.20 seconds of entity balance
Resource:          50 mana
Details:
The plague lord will send to you a bubonis, which when commanded, will
inflict such torment upon your foe with a single touch that their lungs
will fill with fluid(*). If they are already suffering in such a way,
they shall be struck down with slickness.
* Gives asthma.

When primebonded, the bubonis shall act of its own will, inflicting your
foe with maladies of the mind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Piridon (Domination)                          Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            None
Works on/against:  Adventurers and room
Cooldown:          Equilibrium
Details:
When you summon Piridon, he will send to you a doppleganger. The
doppleganger will look like you, though it must be referred to as
'doppleganger'. The doppleganger is much different from other entities
in that it may be remotely commanded.

ORDER DOPPLEGANGER CHANNEL <ab>|CLOAK|EXITS||LOOK|MOVE|RETURN|SEEK <who>

CHANNEL <ab>  : Allows you to channel certain Occult abilities through
                your doppleganger. These include: Ague, Devolution,
                Eldritchmists, Quicken, Shrivel, Timewarp, and Warp.
CLOAK         : Masks your doppleganger's entry and exit.
EXITS         : Shows the exits from the room your doppleganger is in.
LOOK          : Your doppleganger looks at the room it is in.
MOVE <dir>    : Your doppleganger moves in a specific direction.
RETURN        : Your doppleganger returns to you.
SEEK <who>    : Your doppleganger seeks a specific adventurer. If he
                is flying, it will go and wait underneath.
                Trees present no obstacle to this.

Special note about channeling: the channel to your doppleganger is a
two-way link, however briefly it may be in operation. Any backlash from
an attack channeled through your doppleganger has a very high likelihood
of continuing through that link and harming you directly.

you when called upon. When commanded to strike your foe, the hound shall
inspire weariness in them.

present periodically.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tarotlink (Domination)                        Known: No (626 lessons required)

Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          3.00 seconds of balance

able to order it to fling it remotely! Note that not all of the tarots
can be used by the doppleganger. For instance: Death and Hermit, among
others.

Hecate (Domination)                           Known: No (764 lessons required)

Covenant (Domination)                         Known: No (799 lessons required)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            COVENANTS
                   COVENANT ESTABLISH
                   COVENANT DISBAND <covenant>
                   COVENANT MANIFEST <covenant>
Cooldown:          10.00 seconds of equilibrium
Details:
Having established yourself as a practitioner of the art, you are now
able to make pacts on a greater scale than previously. While you have
formed prime bonds with a cadre of the Chaos Lords, you may establish a
covenant. You may have up to two covenants at once, and swap between
them by manifesting the desired of the two.

* This swaps your set of prime bonds.
** This comes with a long equilibrium.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glaaki (Domination)                           Known: No (936 lessons required)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            SUMMON GLAAKI
                   COMMAND ABOMINATION AT <target>
Details:
Ancient; formidable; greatest of the Chaos Lords. The Eldritch Ascendant
is all of these and many things left best unspoken. Ruthlessly
pragmatic, Glaaki tore his rule from the hands of those thought
untouchable. Any who pact with him beware, for slights can fester a
thousand years or more.

To those granted his grace, the Ascendant shall bestow the use of one of
his abominable servants. This avatar, when commanded to violate a victim
whose aura has been made sufficiently vulnerable to external assault,
shall determine the fundamental nature of the target and grant the
occultist the greatest weapon of all; knowledge of their subject's true
name.

(*) an aura can be made sufficiently vulnerable through the cleanseaura
ability in Occultism.
(**) truenames gained in this way have a much shorter lifespan than
those gained through standard methods.
