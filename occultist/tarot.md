Heretic (Tarot)                               Known: Yes

Syntax:            RUINATE HERETIC AT <target>
                   ORDER <target> WITNESS <vision>
Details:
When mysterious forces attempted to gain influence over the Occultists
of Ashtan in the 899th year after the fall of the Seleucarian Empire, a
group of ritualists did the unthinkable and irrevocably damaged the
symbolic nature of their Hierophant. Though it no longer holds any power
in the hands of Occultists, out of their machinations was born a new
card entirely: the first example of a nontransient ruinated image, that
of the Heretic.

When a victim falls under the Heretic's sway, the Occultist may command
them to witness an image: and so long as they are not blind, they will
be unable to avoid gazing upon that which is brought forth.
