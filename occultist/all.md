Details:
You can afflict a person's aura with an ague. This will cause the
unfortunate wretch to freeze in two or three stages. If the target has a
caloric salve applied, this will nullify the caloric salve. If not, then
it will set him or her shivering, which will regularly cause a loss of
equilibrium. If you chill a shivering person, you will freeze him or her
completely. If two of their limbs are broken to the point of needing a
restoration salve, it will perform this freeze twice in a single cast.

nebulous form together. HUMAN is the command to return to your normal
form.
In addition, you may ASTRALISE in a direction to bypass closed doors,
though this is a channeled action and will not bypass doors that are
locked.

Enlighten (Occultism)                         Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            ENLIGHTEN <target>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          4.00 seconds of equilibrium
Resource:          2% karma
Details:
Perhaps the cruelest curse imaginable, you can reveal the occult
mysteries to a non-initiate as you have learned it. Their minds must be
sufficiently open for the revelation to be received. In other words,
they must have six(*) of: claustrophobia, agoraphobia, lovers, dementia,
epilepsy, hallucinations, confusion, stupidity, paranoia, vertigo,
shyness, addiction, recklessness, or masochism.

If such is the case, you may give that target the revelation of what the
nature of the universe is as you see it, which will unfortunately make
their insanities permanent until death.

* This number drops to five if they are suffering from the curse of
whispering madness.

Once you've enlightened the mind of a non-initiate to the mysteries of the Occult, you may draw upon
the latent energies of Entropy and Discord throughout Creation. Focusing these Chaotic ripples upon 
your target's already battered psyche, you may completely unravel his mind, slaying him instantly. 
Slaying an individual in this manner will release a potent karmic aura, buffering your own karma.

Syntax:            COMPEL <target> <compulsion>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Details:
The mysteries of the multiverse are many and great, but the fragile mind
of the unenlightened ever shies away from such possibility. Yet when you
have seized upon the fundamental nature of such a mortal derived from
their yet living person(*), you will find that more delicate
opportunities open up before you.

You may command such a student to observe one of these mysteries. If
they are adequately prepared for the revelation therein, various results
will be made manifest:

Discord:
Requires: the target have the healthleech and asthma afflictions.
Result: their mind will be greatly strained, causing them to be struck
down with the loneliness and dizziness afflictions.

Entropy:
Requires: the target has the haemophilia and addiction afflictions.
Result: the subject will contemplate the nature of time, losing the
speed defence if it is present and being struck down with the curse of
the Aeon if it is not.

Potential:
Requires: the target be afflicted with all four of their limbs being
broken or is frozen.
Result: if the target's limbs are broken, they will suffer a short-lived
blackout. If they are frozen, they will suffer damage.

* It must be a true name acquired via the Glaaki ability in Domination.
** Compelling carries its own internal cooldown, and though it requires
both balance and equilibrium, it consumes neither.

Resource:          Karma
Details:
Congratulations! Your studies have now reached the plateau wherein your
mastery of the occult is so great that you can now prepare your body and
aura for true transformation. Instead of dying, you will transmogrify
into a being of pure chaos--you will become a Chaos Lord. You will
receive one change of the body, skin, and a very odd miscellaneous
change
which correspond to the effects listed below. MUTATIONS will show you
exactly what the functions of the mutations you have are. It will not
show useless mutations (see below).

By raising a barrier between yourself and the Chaos Lord's spirit, you
may prevent your transformation from occurring upon death. This barrier
can be lowered in the future at a much smaller cost.

TRANSMOGRIFY STATUS will show the state of the Chaos Lord within your
soul, if any.

You may only use this ability once every 3-9 (random) Achaean days.

* Note: The chance for positive changes outweighs the chance for
negative changes by nearly a 2-1 margin. It is also possible to get a
useless mutation. For instance, bulging muscles that give no strength
advantage, or blotchy skin that does not subject you to greater magical
damage.

your foul oppressor, while flinging it will begin the process of calling
Death himself to gather the soul of your enemy to him. Be warned though
that this process takes concentration and you may not do anything else
while Death is on his way.

When rubbing Death, normally your card will only gain one charge towards
attunement. However, the number of charges generated for each rub will
be increased for each of a set of conditions that are true(*).

Finally, rubbing death on your target will attempt to freeze that
adventurer, though can only ever make them shiver at worst.

* Death rubs are increased for each of: stun, aeon, entangled,
shivering, or paralysed.

I 100h 0rage 100m 100e 100w[ex] :-ab tarot Heretic
Heretic (Tarot)                               Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            RUINATE HERETIC AT <target>
                   ORDER <target> WITNESS <vision>
Details:
When mysterious forces attempted to gain influence over the Occultists
of Ashtan in the 899th year after the fall of the Seleucarian Empire, a
group of ritualists did the unthinkable and irrevocably damaged the
symbolic nature of their Hierophant. Though it no longer holds any power
in the hands of Occultists, out of their machinations was born a new
card entirely: the first example of a nontransient ruinated image, that
of the Heretic.

When a victim falls under the Heretic's sway, the Occultist may command
them to witness an image: and so long as they are not blind, they will
be unable to avoid gazing upon that which is brought forth.

healthleech.

Cooldown:          3.00 seconds of equilibrium

Marduk will send to you a soulmaster entity. This entity may be ordered
to POSSESS an adventurer. When it does, it will take a few seconds to
gain control of the victim's mind. Once it has done this, you may ORDER
<target> <command>. Doing this is quite difficult for the soulmaster
though, so you will be restricted to doing it once every few seconds.

Details:
The minions the Chaos Court will send to you are limited in their agency
given the constraints they labour under. No matter. A skilled user of
Domination will find they are able to forge bonds with the various Chaos
Lord's upon the Chaos Plane, and by doing so grant the minions those
Lords will send greater freedom when summoned(*).

You may only support up to four bonds at a time, so choose wisely. Bonds
may only be forged in the presence of the Lord you seek to bond with;
they may be severed from anywhere.

* Entities benefitting from a prime bond will act passively in addition
to retaining their active effects. See the ability files for relevant
details for each entity.

If your target is not deaf, they shall suffer an affliction of the mind.

When primebonded, the chimera shall periodically strike out with one of
its heads at a target, causing one of the following effects:
- A roar which will cure a target's deafness if such is present, or
knock them prone with a stun if it is not.
- A headbutt which will knock your foe prone.
- An insidious blast of breath which shall inspire sleep in your enemy.

inflict such torment upon your foe with a single touch that their lungs
will fill with fluid(*). If they are already suffering in such a way,
they shall be struck down with slickness.

When primebonded, the bubonis shall act of its own will, inflicting your
foe with maladies of the mind.
* Gives asthma.

Syntax:            None
Works on/against:  Adventurers and room
Cooldown:          Equilibrium
Details:
When you summon Piridon, he will send to you a doppleganger. The
doppleganger will look like you, though it must be referred to as
'doppleganger'. The doppleganger is much different from other entities
in that it may be remotely commanded.

ORDER DOPPLEGANGER CHANNEL <ab>|CLOAK|EXITS||LOOK|MOVE|RETURN|SEEK <who>

CHANNEL <ab>  : Allows you to channel certain Occult abilities through
                your doppleganger. These include: Ague, Devolution,
                Eldritchmists, Quicken, Shrivel, Timewarp, and Warp.
CLOAK         : Masks your doppleganger's entry and exit.
EXITS         : Shows the exits from the room your doppleganger is in.
LOOK          : Your doppleganger looks at the room it is in.
MOVE <dir>    : Your doppleganger moves in a specific direction.
RETURN        : Your doppleganger returns to you.
SEEK <who>    : Your doppleganger seeks a specific adventurer. If he
                is flying, it will go and wait underneath.
                Trees present no obstacle to this.

Special note about channeling: the channel to your doppleganger is a
two-way link, however briefly it may be in operation. Any backlash from
an attack channeled through your doppleganger has a very high likelihood
of continuing through that link and harming you directly.

Details:
Having established yourself as a practitioner of the art, you are now
able to make pacts on a greater scale than previously. While you have
formed prime bonds with a cadre of the Chaos Lords, you may establish a
covenant. You may have up to two covenants at once, and swap between
them by manifesting the desired of the two.

Details:
Ancient; formidable; greatest of the Chaos Lords. The Eldritch Ascendant
is all of these and many things left best unspoken. Ruthlessly
pragmatic, Glaaki tore his rule from the hands of those thought
untouchable. Any who pact with him beware, for slights can fester a
thousand years or more.

To those granted his grace, the Ascendant shall bestow the use of one of
his abominable servants. This avatar, when commanded to violate a victim
whose aura has been made sufficiently vulnerable to external assault,
shall determine the fundamental nature of the target and grant the
occultist the greatest weapon of all; knowledge of their subject's true
name.

(*) an aura can be made sufficiently vulnerable through the cleanseaura
ability in Occultism.
(**) truenames gained in this way have a much shorter lifespan than
those gained through standard methods.
