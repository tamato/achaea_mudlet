Subj: Ritual

1. Alright, sorry for the state of that log. *sigh* Something strange
happened when I tried to post it. It cut out the entire middle part
where Eris spoke. I'm trying this again.

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "We will
begin now."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "All
please stand."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "Please
shout Hail Eris after my shout."

You see Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant shout,
"We Occultists have gathered to contact Eris! All Hail Eris!"

(Lot of Hail Eris! shouts here.)

An indomitable male voice resounds, "Indeed.. Hail Eris.. The world
needs a little chaos."

An impressive male voice shouts, "Indeed."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "We will
now be beginning the Ritual. I will be going around and moving everyone
into position. Please cooperate, and I ask that you remain silent and
not cause any distractions during the Ritual."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant walks around
moving people around, until he has formed a large pentagon out of the
everyone attending's bodies. He then moves into his position at the
corner spot in the north.

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "We are
gathered here to contact the Goddess Eris. Before we can hope to speak
to Her, we must first reforge our bonds with Chaos."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "No one
person here or anywhere can truly define Chaos. Chaos is amazing in that
it can be anything and nothing to anyone or no one."

Grom nods his head at Klavin.

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "Chaos
is,however, represented, and in a sense embodied by the Goddess Eris. If
any being can define Chaos it is Her."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "However,
defining Chaos is not our point in conducting this Ritual. We are here
to contact Eris, and to do that we need to first have a better
understanding of Her realm, Chaos."

The room shudders slightly.

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "I would
now like to read a paragraph from the Principia Discordia."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant holds a large
leather-bound tome in his hand and opens it to a premarked page.

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says,
""Magicians, and their progeny the scientists, have always taken
themselves and their subject in an orderly and somber manner, thereby
disregarding an essential metaphysical balance. When magicians learn to
approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth,
and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavors, then they will
be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a
clearer understanding of it, and therefore gain more effective magic.
CHAOS IS ENERGY.""

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant closes the book.

You see Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant shout,
"Eris! We ask for Your Divine Voice to speak unto us, Your children once
more! Let us know how we may help in Your awakening! May my conscious
energy be a gateway for You to speak to us through!"

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "I now
shrivel my own limbs as an act of devotion. May my life help bring us a
step closer to Awakening Eris!"

Klavin reaches out to stroke his arm, which withers away at the touch.

Klavin reaches out to stroke his arm, which withers away at the touch.

You feel the floor shake beneath your feet.

You reach out and grasp Klavin's leg in an iron grip, and it shrivels
feebly under your necromantic might.

You reach out and grasp Klavin's leg in an iron grip, and it shrivels
feebly under your necromantic might.

You see Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant shout,
"Eris! I give my life so You may Once more Speak!"

Klavin nods his head at you.

Drawing on the power of undeath, you wreathe your hand in black,
crackling energy. With a diabolical laugh, you stiffen your hand and
slowly run it down Klavin's chest, splitting it open as you do so. With
an expert touch, you rip apart his innards, causing a maximum of
horrifying pain, and, enjoying the spectacle of Klavin writhing and
screaming in agony, you rip out his sternum and drive it through his
splayed body, pinning him to the ground to die.

You have slain Klavin.

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall releases a thin grin from his shadowed face as he
watches Klavin and Lemon.

A thousand colored lights dance before your eyes, filling the room with
untold brilliance.

You shout, "With this mortal sacrifice, we infuse Klavin's life force
with a message from Eris. We ask that she speaks with us, and tell us
how to awaken her."

Lemon closes her eyes and concentrates on Klavin's energy. She focuses
on infusing the energy with the message.

You say, "I urge everyone here to concentrate on the energy."

You say, "Concentrate on the message to Eris, we wish for her to tell us
how to awaken her."

You are filled with awe as the lights weave their dance about you.

Dread Karnak, Disciple of Chaos closes his eyes and concentrates on
Klavin's energy. He focuses on infusing the energy.

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall focuses his gaze to the middle of the pentagram,
enforcing his mind upon the energy.

Aine Ocarina Ambrai bows her head and closes her eyes, lending her lifes
energy to working.

Obtenebrating Labryrinthians, Embrye Sly, Atrabilious Codfishicists
closes her eyes, concentrating deeply on the energy.

Seeing his situation to be hopeless, Klavin begins uttering fervent
prayers for salvation.

Kald, Seeker of Knowledge closes his eyes focusing on the energy.

Dreamseeker Jem, the Sleeping Visionary bows her head slowly,
concentrating on infusing the energy.

The lights focus upon the body of Klavin, gathering close about his
withered body.

Cold Grom Le'au, the Dark Wanderer bows his head and focuses on the
energy.

Chaotic Dark Mistress, Samantha Le'au, Lover of Discord closes her eyes,
focusing on the energy.

You say, "Good. I will now attempt to send the message to the Lady
Eris."

Without warning the lights dissappear into the corpse of Klavin. Slowly
it fades and dissapears into the ether.

You look on in astonishment as the impaled corpse of Klavin fades away
into the ether.

Lemon focuses deeply on the remaining life energy of Klavin. The message
to Eris is prepared, and with the disappearance of the body goes the
message.

You hear a whispering voice in the distance.

You shout, "Lady Eris, we have offered Your follower to You in
sacrifice, with a message. We humbly ask You for a reply, to let us know
how we may bring You back!"

You say, "If we could all shout Hail Eris once more..."

(Much more Hailage of Eris)

You say, "I have heard a whisper... have the rest of you heard it as
well?"

Like bells in the wind you hear a soft voice, '... My children...'

You say, "Lady Eris, Your children await you... please tell us how we
may help You return to us."

The voice continues, '... I.. will not... be returning any time soon...
I do not expect... to ever return...'

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin arrives from the south.

'Why do you seek me?' says the voice as it grows in strength.

Amanuensis
To : Everyone
Subj: Ritual Log continued...

You say, "Lady Eris, there are many, many people who still believe and
follow Chaos. Whatever is necessary, we can do it."

You say, "Your children seek to know You once more. We want to see Your
return to the realm, and see Chaos once again become known."

You say, "Many of us are working to spread Your past teachings, but
Chaos is not the same without Your divine presence."

'I grow tired... You do well without me.' says the voice.

You say, "We cannot every completely regain the spirit of Chaos without
You. Lady Eris, You are the spirit of Chaos... we will try to strengthen
you to the best of our ability, we only need to know how."
The voice changes to a tone of anger, 'I will not return... I do not
wish to return...'

You say, "Lady Eris, we mean no disrespect, and we did not mean to anger
you. Why do You not wish to return?"

The body of Morlana is suddenly surrounded by a shaft of bright yellow
light.

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Your
world bores me. I will not be returning. This will be my final visit."

You say, "Please, Lady Eris, is there nothing we can do? We as followers
have worked for a long time to keep Chaos alive in the minds of
Achaeans."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "You
will continue to do so then."

Morlana's body begins to shake from the pain.

You say, "We will, always."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "I
leave you now mortals..."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "Eris,
good luck in what ever you leave us for..."

You say, "Please Lady Eris... there must be something we can do? We do
not wish for you to go."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "If
you need assistance from the gods, look to my siblings in the garden."

You say, "Lady Eris, the Occultists have been lost without Your
guidance... is there any other you can suggest who would be fit to
oversee us? We cannot find another who could ever take care of us as You
did."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "That
is a hard question... You are my children..."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Which
of the gods seeks to assist you, which of the gods has helped you the
most?"

You say, "We will always be Your children. We need you here with us,
Lady Eris. Just the hope that someday you may return is what's kept us
going."

You say, "Lord Sartan was of most help, but he eventually tried to
impose his ideals upon us. But we will never lose the ideals that You
left us."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Sartan may still be your best choice children, I have seen that he
works had to further your skills. It was he who brokered the final pact
with Golgotha. Although the choice is yours."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "He
has his own ideals however, and is hard to trust."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "The
choice is yours children... I must leave now."

You say, "Lady Eris, You leave us for now... but will there ever be a
day You may decide to return? Can we continue to hope that someday...?"
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Perhaps.... I find it unlikely."

The pillar of light fades. Leaving the room dark once more.

You say, "Some of us will wait and hope anyway."

You ponder the situation.

You shout, "Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!"

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Wait
for what?"

(Much Hailing of Eris here.)

You say to Morlana, "You were channeling the Goddess."

You give Morlana a compassionate hug.

You see Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati
shout, "Hail Eris!"

Morlana blinks.

An Amazonian voice booms, "Fnord!"

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall wraps his cloak firmly around his body, regaining
the posture of a monk.

You see Erubus, of the Fens shout, "Hail Eris, Discordia Eribus."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant falls to the
floor.

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "I
didn't see anything."

Ringing vibrantly, a male voice shouts, "Try something a lil different
to get eris back try like um try that unnamed horror experiment again."


You say, "Well, a shaft of yellow light covered you, and you spoke to
us, as the Lady Eris."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "What
did she say?"

You say, "She said that she would most likely never return to us."

You crease your brow in a frown.

Obtenebrating Labryrinthians, Embrye Sly, Atrabilious Codfishicists says
to Klavin, "Klavin?"

Tears fill Klavin's eyes and begin to slowly run down his face.

Morlana ponders the situation.

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "You
sure that wasnt' an illusion?"

Morlana pats Klavin in a friendly manner.

You say, "She said we may choose another patron if we wanted to."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "It may
have been, but it could only have been the illusion sent by another
God."

Morlana shrugs nonchalantly.

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Who?"

You say, "She said this was her last visit."

You crease your brow in a frown.

You say, "I believe that was the Lady Eris. But I'm very depressed."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Maybe."

Kald, Seeker of Knowledge says, "Look up....perhaps next time she
intends to stay."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "So
what are you going to do?"

Kald, Seeker of Knowledge says, "Not a mere visit."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Wow
im tired."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "I
just slept!"

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "I'm sure
being posesed put a strain on your body."

You say, "I'm going to wait, and hope, and keep spreading knowledge of
Chaos, like I've always done."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "You
should rest Morlana."

Morlana nods her head at Klavin.

Dread Karnak, Disciple of Chaos says, "Are we free to retire? I have
many things to consider."

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall says, "There is one aspect I learned from Chaos
which is this. Its outcome is never predictable."

Morlana beams broadly at Nazhoul.

You say to Klavin, "You should rest too... are you alright?"

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall says, "Therefor I see no sense in becoming
discouraged."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "I'll be
fine, just a little drained form my death."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Someone record this event? I'd like to see it."

You say, "I've got it, I'll post it."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "Thank you
for your help Lemon."

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall says, "Scholar Lemon, might I make a suggestion?"

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says, "Well, the
goodnews is it worked."

The corners of Klavin's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.

You say, "Sorry for delays, I'm a tiny bit lagged."

You say to Klavin, "And you're welcome."

Nazhoul Zar Na'dall says, "If you desire to spread Chaos throughout this
realm with the Occultists as your basis, why should we have a patron
unless she is Eris?"

Dread Karnak, Disciple of Chaos says, "The reason we have tried to
summon Er

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Or
rather she is ordered thought fused with chaos."

Kald, Seeker of Knowledge says, "Perhaps we should try her Experiment
again."

Dread Karnak, Disciple of Chaos says, "I learned that at a very eairly
stage in my life - it is knowledge I have possessed all through my
upbringing. I am currently trying to seek more knowledge and an
understanding of the diety in question."

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "It
will take the rest of your life and beyond before you understand an
inkling."

Morlana grins mischievously at Karnak.

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "But
it's good that you are taking that step."

Vehemence of Entropy, Klavin Rihwin, Clandestine Savant says,
"Understanding Chaos is the easiest thing to do, but also the heardest."

Dread Karnak, Disciple of Chaos says, "I am a scholar in life - and the
duty of a scholar is to learn everything he can. Everything is in Chaos.
Therefore studying chaos seems to be a logical step."

Throwing his hands in the air, Klavin tosses his head back and laughs
sadistically.

(And that's all... I left the end stuff in because it was good
discussion. *grin*)

From: Sgueg Devi, Achaean Geographer
To  : Everyone
Subj: birth of the thaumaturgist sect
 
This ritual took place at the peak of the Erisian Pyramid and celebrated
the birth of a new sect.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin sprinkles a white powder around all
those attending in a large circle. He then places the bag of dust on an
alter set up at the North end of the circle.
 
Ximili Ximilus sneezes as he inhales a bit of the dust.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin looks off distantly to the north,
chanting arcane incantations, until a soft green aura can be seen in the
North.

Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin turns to the east, chanting again,
and raising his arms into the Air. A soft breeze begins from the east,
and quickly picks up as Klavin raises his Arms higher. It softens again
as he lowers them.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin he looks to the south, and bows his
head. Moments later, you can detect a wave of heat, as if from an unseen
fire building from the south.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin turns to the West, breathing in
deeply. A sensation like a large wave of energy sweeps of the circle,
causing everything within to feel cleansed and refreshed in the Mind.
 
Ximili Ximilus takes a step towards the south, only to begin sweating
profusely.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "Greetings all those in
attendance, both the seen and unseen. We have gathered here in
celebration. The Thaumaturgist are to be official Founded with this
Ritual of Dedication."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "Those whom have been
appointed my Assistants, step forward and stand at my side."
 
Ximili Ximilus walks over towards Klavin, standing at his right.
 
Shakti Devi, Black Sun Rising takes a step forward and stands at
Klavin's left.
 
Opportunist Silverstorm Saer'rac, Dark Priestess glides forward, shadows
playing across her figure as she stands behind Klavin.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "I now ask The Demiurge of the
Occultists to speak to us all, and Give Her approval for the Formation
of The Thaumaturgists."
 
Morlana nods her head at Klavin.
 
Klavin tilts his head and listens intently to Morlana.
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Welcome everyone to the Occutists first official formal sect ritual."
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "I
come before you to express approval for this sect and to give voice to
Golgotha to place his approval and well being upon these proceedings and
future rites."
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "Let
none perform or attend with feelings ambivalent towards the guild. Let
none disrupt that which has been carefully planned. All rituals, rites
and practices are done for the benefit of the Occultists' guild and for
the Occultist."
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Despite the differences of each of us we are ONE guild. Different
directions ONE goal. Many hands ONE heart and desire to make this a
success. I'd like to remind everyone that whatever goes on in this
ritual is to remain in this guild."
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati throws some
powder up into the air and smiles in pleasure as it bursts into a
rainbow of showering sparks and tiny explosions.
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says, "I am
pleased to see that this sect is now sanctioned."
 
Morlana nods her head at Klavin.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "With this The Thaumaturgists
are formed! May we always use our talents in the Arcane Arts to better
the Guild, and may our Magical Insight help to find the best possible
path for the Occultists on their road to Glory!"
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "And now, the Initiation of
The First members of the Thaumaturgists."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "Are you prepared to be made
full members, Shakti, Ximili, and Silverstorm?"

Ximili shrugs helplessly.
 
Shakti Devi, Black Sun Rising nods her acceptance.
 
Opportunist Silverstorm Saer'rac, Dark Priestess bows to Klavin, quietly
saying, "Aye...".
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin takes a bowl from the alter and
sprinkles some of the white powdery contents onto each of the three.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "May The salt of the Earth
give you the Strength to Stand up for the Guild when necessary, and the
Strength to remain silent and unacting when it will best protect and
benefit the Guild, as well as the Sect."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin puts the bowl down and takes a
feather from the alter. He runs the feather along the forehead of each
Initiate.
 
Ximili giggles happily.
 
Ximili Ximilus says, "It tickles."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "May the Air grant you a Clear
Mind, and better Knowledge. May you be enlightened in the matters of
Magic and Ritual, so you may better use them to benefit the Guild and
yourself."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin places the feather down, and picks
up a burning red candle.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "Run your hands through the
flame. May the Fire keep the passion and vigor within you burning
strong."
 
Ximili Ximilus passes his hand slowly through the flame of the candle,
wincing slightly.
 
Morlana closes her eyes briefly.

Opportunist Silverstorm Saer'rac, Dark Priestess lowers her hand on the
flame, expression unchanged as it burns her.
 
Klavin nods his head at Morlana.
 
Shakti Devi, Black Sun Rising smiles mysteriously as she slowly caresses
the candleflame with her hand.
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati makes a
gesture towards a wormhole and motions everyone to go down one level.
 
Morlana rolls her eyes.
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati points
south.
 
You follow Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin south to Upon the steps
almost reaching the Great Erisian Pyramid's peak.

Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Continue."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin carfull places everything back down,
successfult moveing the whole circle.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin places the candle back on the alter
and grabs a bowl of water. He sprinkles a few drops on each of the
Three.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "May the Water cleans your
mind and body of all it's past impurities. Let the Elements cleans and
strengthen you. You are now prepared to enter life as a Thaumaturgist,
with the help of the Elements. On your path with us you will strive to
find the blessings of the Fifth Element, Chaos."
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "I know Proclaim Ximili,
Shakti, and Silverstorm to now be Full Members of the Thaumaturgist
Sect!"
 
Ximili shrugs helplessly.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin looks to each of the Directions
uttering more arcane incantations, and each of the unseen presence you
noticed before disappear.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin walks around the circle sweeping
away the dust and closing the Circle.
 
Opportunist Silverstorm Saer'rac, Dark Priestess whispers quiet thanks
to the Quarters as they fade away.
 
Occult Thaumaturgist, Klavin Rihwin says, "The Ritual is Closed. Thanks
to all for attending."
 
Primi Qui'anar Baroness Morlana S. Ni'Choya, The Illuminati says,
"Congratulations everyone."

Subj: Ritual Log
 
Greetings. This is the log of the ritual, as well as all that followed
up until the time I left.. It is rather long, and of course strange
*grin* Anyways, here it is:
 
Klavin Rihwin moves to the alter in the room, examining the tools layed
upon it.
 
Klavin Rihwin turns around the room, looking to all in attendence.
 
Borknagar blinks.
 
Fitz scratches his head in confusion.
 
Sgueg closes his eyes and bows his head.
 
Fitz closes his eyes and bows his head.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "One moment... we will continue in a second...."
 
Borknagar Jukka, The Baptist says, "Take your time."
 
Borknagar's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
 
The body of Sgueg Devi appears in a flash and his soul descends to fill
it, causing the previously expressionless face to fill with emotion.
 
Sgueg mutters discontentedly.
 
The body of Nazhoul Zar Na'dall appears in a flash and his soul descends
to fill it, causing the previously expressionless face to fill with
emotion.
 
Mordyval arrives from the east.

"Greetings!" Mordyval says with a smile.
 
Llewellyn greets Mordyval with a sincere smile.
 
Glorfindel raises his hand in greeting to Mordyval and says "Hi!"
 
Nazhoul Zar Na'dall grumbles as he touches his pounding forehead.
 
Mordyval raises his hand in greeting to Klavin and says "Hi!"
 
Fitz doffs his hat cordially at Mordyval.
 
Borknagar raises his hand in greeting to Mordyval and says "Hi!"
 
Klavin nods his head at Mordyval.
 
Borknagar's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
 
You give Mordyval a compassionate hug.

Borknagar enthuses, "Sure!"

have gathered this day to give thanks to the forces of Chaos present in
this world."
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Chaos is all things and nothing, it is present
anywhere you look in this world. Try and escape it, and you will only
run into another of it's many forms."
 
A swirling portal of chaos opens, spits out a minion of chaos, then
vanishes.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "This, is an obvious example. Our might asset is our
skill in Domination. These great beings from the Chaos Plane have helped
us in countless battles with our foes."
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Look upon this Minion of the Chaos Lords, and think
of the many other entities you have met. They range from the grotesque
to the beautiful, the weak to the mighty."

Herself. He segnifigence to Chaos is most obvious."

The corners of Fitz's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "These forms are the easiest to see in this world.
But there are many others. Look to the Church of Achaea, they preach of
Light, and what is Rightous, yet, they welcomed the chance to use the
Infernals, the Lords of Evil, to win the last Landmark season. Yet,
would it not be wrong for an insurment of the Light, to work with those
of Darkness? Apparently not... This Hipocracy is a grand example of
Chaos."
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "The seeds of Chaos and Discord are strewn all over
the land, all you must do is look and see how these seeds have grown an

Colours fleck and fly about in a whirlwind.
 
Someone powerful says, "In the center of the room, an image begins to
form, strange and undulating."
 
Klavin Rihwin watches in eager anticipation.
 
Suddenly, a loud crack sounds in the room and a strange form emerges and
bows to you.
 
Glorfindel narrows his eyes and then blinks rapidly, several times.
 
Borknagar blinks.
 
Fitz bows respectfully to a very strange thing of chaos.
 
Mordyval Danarrii clenches his eyes shut hard then reopens them.
 
With a flourish of his arm, A very strange thing of chaos bows deeply.
 
Borknagar's mouth turns up as his face breaks into a smile.
 
Llewellyn snuggles up close to a Golden Apple of Eris, looking happy and
content.

now that you have arrived?"

Klavin Rihwin says, "My friends, as you can see, Chaos takes many forms,
some more odd then others, but all equaly valuable to this world."

another small part of Chaos shall be seen, You thing are like us and
all, a part of the whole, a part of everything and a part of nothing at
all. Welcome."

A very strange thing of chaos flexes his muscles in an impressive
display of strength.
 
Klavin flashes a very strange thing of chaos a joyous smile.
 
Nazhoul Zar Na'dall says, "While others would mock, hide or destroy a
being that does not resemble to their own 'orderely' truth, I too
embrace you, thing, as my brother in life and existence."
 
You see Mordyval Danarrii shout, "Hail Chaos, Hail Eris, Hail all that
can be percieved and all that can not even be comprehended."
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "There are those among this realm who will dispute
the power of Chaos, they are ignorant, and blind tot he world. They
refuse to see the light of Chaos. I suggest you deal with them as you
would with a toy, use them to your enjoyment, and if you feel kind that
day, try and teach them a lesson as you amuse yourself."
 
Borknagar grins

To  : Everyone
Subj: The Ritual
 
This is the Ritual which took place on the 21st through the 22nd of
Mayan in the 299th year after the fall. The attendants were Myself,
Klavin (who held the Ritual), Fitz, Shakti, Dracodian, Miriyan, Relios,
and Ablar. On behalf of the guild I thank those who attended and those
who were lending their support from afar.
 
On with the show
 
Klavin Rihwin walks up the the alter, examining the tools.

You say, "Everyone ready?"

Shakti nods her head emphatically.
Dracodian nods his head emphatically.
Ablar nods his head emphatically.
You nod your head emphatically.
Relios nods his head emphatically.
Miriyan nods her head emphatically.

You say, "Commence when ready then Klavin."

Klavin Rihwin says, "Then let us begin...."

Klavin Rihwin says, "Hail, Brethren! Thank you for attending. Today, we
are gathered so that we can strengthen in the Guild and give us the edge
in the upcoming Crossing and Year 300 Events."

Klavin Rihwin says, "With the power we call upon tonight, no Mortal will
stand a chance agenst us in these events."

Klavin Rihwin slowly raises one of the Ritual daggers from the alter.

Klavin Rihwin says, "Tonight, I give my blood to strengthen the Guild. I
will ask you all to do the same, after me."

Shakti nods her head at Klavin, showing her acceptance.

You say, "And we shall give our blood in strength."

Klavin Rihwin holds his hand over one the ornate cups set upon the
altar. Quickly, he pulls the blade across his palm, then places the
dagger down, moving his hand to squeeze his wrist, causing his blood to
drip into the cup.

Klavin Rihwin drains that last of his blood into the cup, and calls for
the others in attendence to step up and do the same.

Knovbel steps up to the altar and slowly reaches for the Ritual dagger.

Klavin Rihwin says, "I ask now, Brethren. The Guild has given you
knowledge, now I call upon you to return the favor with an offering of
your blood."

Knovbel holds his hand over one of the ornate cups set upon the altar.
Slowly dragging the Ritual Dagger along his palm, cutting his skin. He
sets the dagger upon the altar, and allows his blood to drain into the
cup.

Knovbel places his hands together and removes the last of his blood into
the cup.

Mlle. Shakti Devi strides forward and takes hold of the ritual dagger.

Mlle. Shakti Devi turns her other hand toward the sky. Without
hesitation, she quickly slashes across the wrist, a thin pale line of
red first forming on her pale olive skin then becoming a thick rope of
crimson.

Knovbel licks his lips and grins sadistically.

Mlle. Shakti Devi raises her wrist over the cup, watching expressionless
as her blood rains down into the cup. As the flow slows, and stops, she
murmurs, "Vitem et sanguinem.".

Mlle. Shakti Devi steps back and clasps her fingers together around her
waist, watching the others patiently.

Shalafi Necromancer Fitz Ximilus, the Dark One silently walks up to the
altar and grasps the ritual dagger. Extending a pale arm, he makes long
gashes on each finger of his left hand, and allows the blood to drain
into the cup.

Shalafi Necromancer Fitz Ximilus, the Dark One waits patiently until the
blood stops to flow from his fingers, and then mutters something
unaudible and draws back into the crowd.

You say, "Ablar. Would you like to go next?"

Ablar nods his head emphatically.

The Reverend Father Ablar, Lord of Corruption walks up to alter and
grasps the ritual dagger.

The Reverend Father Ablar, Lord of Corruption slowly raising his arm he
places the blade against his soft flesh.

The Reverend Father Ablar, Lord of Corruption slashes furiously across
his wrist as the satin liquid protrudes. Slowly it trickles down into
the ornate cup.

The Reverend Father Ablar, Lord of Corruption grips his arm making his
hand go white as he drains the last drop into the cup. Slowly he steps
back with the others.

Relios steps up to the altar,and smiling down at the ritual
dagger,slowly picks it up.

Relios prostrating himself before the altar,silently murmurs "For the
Guild" and savagely slashes his wrist,draining the life into the cup.

Relios drains the final bit into the cup,and slowly steps back,with a
smile.

Floccinaucinihilipilificater Miriyan, Asphodel Mignonette Lullaby steps
up to the altar and takes the dagger gently into her hands.
      
Floccinaucinihilipilificater Miriyan, Asphodel Mignonette Lullaby
kneeling before the altar, she slowly runs the edge of the dagger along
her right wrist, creating a red line of blood upon her skin.

Floccinaucinihilipilificater Miriyan, Asphodel Mignonette Lullaby smiles
as the last drops of blood empties into the cup, and steps away from the
altar.

Dracodian, Occultic Necrophage walks to the alter and takes hold of the
dagger in his left hand.

Dracodian then raises the dagger over his right, making a cut and
letting his blood flow as water into the cup.

Knovbel clasps Miriyan's cut right hand in his cut left palm.

He turns to her and winks mischeviously.

Dracodian waits until the cut stops bleeding and mumbles a few words,
then steps back.

You nod your head emphatically.

Klavin Rihwin says, "Is that everyone?"

Knovbel smiles at the new members willingness for sacrificing for the
guild.
Fitz nods his head emphatically.
Mlle. Shakti Devi says, "Indeed."
You nod your head at Klavin.
Relios nods his head emphatically.
Ablar nods his head emphatically.

The air crackles with an electric charge as the energies of Chaos stream
into the room, warping the very walls. Twisting throughout the room, a
whirlwind of multi-coloured lights shimmering and glowing in the
manifestation madness. Klavin Rihwin takes up a wand from the altar and
holds it high into the air above the blood filled cup.

Klavin Rihwin says, "Spirits bound to this Realm, for many months I have
bled myself of my precious lifes blood and essence in preparation for
this day! I now call upon you to return the favor. Bestow this cup with
a portion of your essence and power! Remember the bond you have to me
through my sacrifice and grant my request!"

Fitz glows purple.
Miriyan glows green.
Dracodian glows orange.
You glow bright yellow and are blessed with strength of intellect.
Klavin glows violet.
Shakti glows pink.
Ablar glows turquoise.
 
Knovbel raises his arms in embrace of the gift.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Now my brethren, by strengthening the head, the
body flourishes. As head of our organization, the Demiurge shall now
drink and receive this power. And as a symbol of this Guild, we all
shall receive the benefits. Demiurge Shakti, Drink now of this precious
blood of power."

Shakti nods her head emphatically.

Mlle. Shakti Devi accepts the chalice, now full to the brim with her own
blood mixed with the guild's.

Klavin Rihwin breathes in deep, watching in eager anticipation.

Mlle. Shakti Devi raises the ritual cup to her lips and drinks deeply,
both her hands clasped tightly around its base.

Knovbel licks his lips in anxious hunger.

Klavin Rihwin says, "Hail to the spirits around us! Hail to the
Occultists and to Chaos!"

You say, "Hail!"

Mlle. Shakti Devi sets the chalice down on the altar.

Shalafi Necromancer Fitz Ximilus, the Dark One chants, "Hail."

Relios says, "Hail!"

The Reverend Father Ablar, Lord of Corruption says, "Hail."

Dracodian says, "Hail to the Guild!"

Floccinaucinihilipilificater Miriyan, Asphodel Mignonette Lullaby says,

Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

Klavin Rihwin says, "My thanks go out the all of you for your sacrifice,
and to the spirits and energies within this room that have granted us
these gifts."

You say, "I would also like to say thank you."

You say, "To the new members who were so eager to help the guild."

Shakti nods her head at you, showing her acceptance.

Marle N'vld, The Dark Jester yells, "Nope."

Dracodian blushes furiously.

Shalafi Necromancer Fitz Ximilus, the Dark One cants his head with the
slightest of nods.

Mlle. Shakti Devi says, "And thank you to Klavin for planning this
ritual."

Klavin Rihwin says, "And now, my brethren, I close the Ritual."

Ok. If you read through the whole long, tedious, yet incredibly
interesting Ritual, then you may have a question of, "wow, what do those
glowing colors mean?"
 
Well, Relios glew red, he recieved "Strength of Heart"
Fitz glew purple, he recieved "Strength of Madness" (fitting huh)
Miriyan glew green and recieved "Strength of Beauty" (also fitting)
Dracodian glew orange and recieved "Strength of Perseverance" this is an
interesting one I think we're all looking forward to seeing.
I glew yellow and recieved the "Gift of Intellect" (I don't think it
fits, but I'm interested in finding out that I'm wrong)
Klavin glew violet, and recieved "Strength of Knowledge" (awesome)
Shakti glew pink and recieved "Strength of Leadership" (as if she needed
more strength in that department, but it will only help us even more)
Ablar glew turquoise and recieved the "Gift of Hope" (Prophetic if you
ask me, I hope we get to see)
 
After my log cut off we were supprised to find that Shakti was slammed
into by a prismatic light and begin to glow in a prismatic state. Only
Eris knows what this prophecises. But I know that this will give us the
edge this century
 
May the Occultists thrive in the next century, as we thrived in the
last.

Subj: last ritual performed by Klavin our Master Thaumaturgist
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Greetings my Brethren, today we are here to
celebrate the return to Occultism."
 
Katoreos tilts his head and listens intently.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "For many years, the Occultists have been lost,
misguided into the dark arts of Necromancy, and forgeting the true
teachings of the Occult."
 
Prophesy creases her brow in a frown.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "No more! We are truly Occultists once again! We
have finally returned to our sacred arts of Occultism!"
 
Klavin Rihwin walks over to a prearanged alter in the center of the
room, and casualy lifts a small dagger.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "We once learned mastery over death, and could bend
it at our will..."
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "But, why bend death, when one can manipulate
reality itself! We can bend the auras of our enemies, whipe them clean,
twist them, do nearly anything we wish to with the lessons we have
learned in Occultism."
 
Klavin Rihwin holds the dagger in place over the wrist of his now
upturned arm.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "And why offer blood to strengthen our bond with
Occultism, when we now have the karmic energies?"

Klavin Rihwin sets the dagger back down, and looks up at the room.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Please join me, my breathren, in adding your own
karam to this room, and to the group karma here. Let us make a karmic
offering here to show our comitment to our rediscovered teachings."
 
Klavin Rihwin closes his eyes, bowing his head as he concentrates on
flowing his karmic energy out and letting it collect in the room.
 
Prophesy moves tentatively forward a step and closes her eyes.
 
Sui generis Aneila Saer'rac, Omnium-gatherum sits quietly concentrating
on releasing her Karmic energies.

Sgueg closes is eyes as he let his aura and his karma flowing from his
body.
 
Seeker of Discordia, Katoreos Sa'Rithven steps foward, bowing his head
and closing his eyes, as the white scale atop his head flares with a
slow white light.
 
Smart Cookie Nerull, Seeker of Books closes his eyes.
 
Klavin Rihwin begins to sweat just slightly as the karma begins to
collect in the room, balling into a large sphear of karmic energies.

Smart Cookie Miriyan Relkatha, the Black Rose closes her eyes and
concentrates on letting her karma flow out into the middle of the room.

Seeker of Discordia, Katoreos Sa'Rithven grits his teeth, as the scale
atop his head glows brighter, his karmic energy flowing into the room.
 
Aquis Aquis closes his eyes and releases his karma flow into the room.
 
Klavin Rihwin opens his eyes suddenly as he holds out his arms twords
the center of the room.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Yes, we have gathered much group karma here...."
 
You see Klavin Rihwin shout, "Hail Eris! All Hail Discordia!"

A weak male voice shouts, "Hail Eris!"
 
Klavin Rihwin stairs at the sphear, and watches as it slowly drifts dwn
to the center of the room.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "May we not forget the teaching of Occultism..."

Seeker Martok, Keeper of the Ninth Station closes his eyes and lets his
Karma flow out.
 
Klavin Rihwin closes his eyes as the sphear suddenly shoots up,
colliding with the roof and resulting a bright explosion, leaving
glowing particals of the karmic energies floating down and blessing
those in the room.
 
Prophesy casts her eyes upward in wonder.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "May Chaos plant itself in your hearts, and grow
into a mighty apple tree. The Ritual is complete..."
 
Seeker Martok, Keeper of the Ninth Station falls to his knees in awe.
 
Prophesy's mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.

Prophesy says, "Thank you Klavin."

Klavin Rihwin smiles up as the energies land on him like brightly
coloured snow.
 
Aneila claps her hands together merrily.
 
Seeker of Discordia, Katoreos Sa'Rithven smiles softly, the scale atop
his head brightening slowly, then fading.
 
Klavin Rihwin says, "Thank you all for your help today."

Seeker Martok, Keeper of the Ninth Station sits dumbfounded, deep in
contemplation.
 
Sui generis Aneila Saer'rac, Omnium-gatherum says, "Thank youuu!"
 
Seeker Martok, Keeper of the Ninth Station says, "Thank you indeed!"
 
"Thanks!" Nerull says.
 
Miriyan calls out "Thank you."

"Thanks!" Aquis says.
 
Sgueg takes a deep breath, his feathers scintillating briefly when some
particles collide with them.
 
Seeker of Discordia, Katoreos Sa'Rithven says, "Thank ye."
 
With a flourish of his arm, Klavin bows deeply.
 
Thank you Klavin for your work.

Subj: Last ritual
 
Greetings brethren I take my pen today to narrate our effort in helping
our matron's husband. At Klavin's call we gathered at the guildhall
temple in order to perform a ritual with the only purpose to help Aegis
in the recovery of his son.
 
Klavin announced his intent to create a small rift between the plane and
send our grouped energies in support to Aegis. He then created a small
orb of light over his palm and throwed it toward the ceiling. While the
ball floated near the ceiling, Klavin asked everyone to make it grow and
everyone by his own means gave his own energies and added it to the ball
of light.
 
Chanting arcane words, Klavin reached a dagger and imbued it with magic.
He then thrusted the dagger forward. The dagger guided by the will to
seek Aegis pierced through the fabric of space, opening a small rift
between our plane and where Aegis chase Slith.
 
Urged by Klavin who could not hold the gateway open for a long time, all
applied their will to send the orb through the swirling black vortex. As
the ball stroke towards into it, sending a beacon of phosphorescent
light into the void, the voice of Aegis echoed : "Slith, I have found
you! I shall destroy you!".
 
Taunting him, Slith responded : "Fool! You have to catch me first." and
sent us one of his minion. Surprised by the brutal appearance of a
wraith, the gathered occultists still showed a prompt display of their
strength by killing the wraith in few seconds, Nimby earning the killing
blow.
 
Afterward the rift closed without Slith sending us another of his
minions.
 
Hope our action will help Aegis or at least have distracted a bit Slith
and many thank to everyone who helped in the ritual.

Subj: Ritual
 
I'm currently designing a ritual that will, hopefully, open up a portal
to the daemonic plane. Now, why would anyone ever want to do that? First
of all, revenge. They came onto our turf, and we can go onto theirs.
Secondly, if we do this, we can get some muscle from the Church to help
out. We strengthen relations, they get to free Valeo and provide us with
a lovely group of potential voluntary sacrificial lambs, and I doubt
that anyone would expect this to come.
 
On to the ritual. I feel that the best place to hold it would be the
Demon Mirror in Polyargos. In the room with that, a pentacle of blood
will be drawn (Afflicted was kind enough to show me how their summonings
work, so that symbol may be relevant).

A lit black candle will be placed at each of the five points, and behind
each candle will be a mirror facing inward at the center of the
pentacle. In the center I'd like to have a personal effect of Valeo's as
a linking object, and that is also where I will stand with the
sacrifice.
 
The subject to be sacrificed has remained the subject of some debate
with those I'm working with on this. There are three ways to choose one:
purest of good, most vile of evil, or a permutation of the two (i.e.
seraphic priest who has drank the blood of a baalzadeen). Occultists, 1
or 2 behind each mirror, will focus their karmic energies into a ritual
dagger. I will slit my wrist with the dagger and drive it straight to
the heart of the sacrifice, then attempt to use it to tear open the
planar fabric and open a transcendence portal, modified by this process,
to the daemon plane.
 
So far, it seems there are four possible outcomes of this. The first is
the hoped for result: we open up a portal, the Church runs in and is
ripped apart by daemons, and we apply our research to traveling in
search of Slith in the future. The second possibility is that we will
summon an extremely large and irate daemon. However, we should have
enough muscle around to take care of damn near anything that can pop
out, so we are prepared for that eventuality. Third, nothing will
happen. I'll stand in the middle of a circle of people, blood gushing
out of my wrist, looking rather surprised and quite embarassed. And of
course, whenever something unusual is tried, there is the chance of a
totally unforseen event occurring, hopefully one that is beneficial, but
you never know.
 
That's what I have so far. I welcome further ideas on the subject, and
hopefully this ritual will be a success.

Subj: Ezekial's Solution to the Security Problem
 
Alright, quick update for everyone!
 
Ezekial was thinking about our security problems, and remembering the
old setup of the Chaos Plane, went out to locate the previous exit, the
Ashtan Cabal's ritual chamber. Poking around the Library, he met up with
Shazir, and soon had a good group of us together.
 
He explained that the old Cabal was based right where the Library is
now, and the Chamber was underground, though not as far as the Deepest
Archives. Since it probably wouldn't have been paved over, we set to
looking for the entrance. Nerull and Palius found a raised portion of
the mosaic, inscribed with ancient Occult runes that none of us could
read.

Pushing in this mosaic opened a secret trapdoor in the floor, through
which was a beautiful room, so infused with arcane energy that the air
still glowed after all these years. Asking Klavin to perform the ritual
to move the Chaos Plane's exit from the Guildhall to the Library,
Ezekial retired to meditate.
 
And that's where we stand as of this post. I think more will be revealed
when we decipher the writing on the Mosaic.
 
Forever Yours, Karyn.

Subj: The Ritual
 
Our ritual was a success!
 
Using Saruman's athame as a focus, Klavin led everyone in making contact
with the Chaos Plane, as if we were to Transcend. A great rift opened in
the wall, and Jy'barrak Golgotha appeared to us! He asked why we wanted
the move, and what we've been doing about the invaders, and, satisfied
with Klavin's responses, turned the Whirlpool to the Ritual Chamber.
Saruman went to confirm that it worked.
 
There was one major change to the layout of the Library, though. When I
went to see Eschy, I found that speaking the password in the Lobby
didn't work! After a bit of panic, Fate found that you must speak the
Password in the Ritual Chamber to access the Archives. Remember that you
Push the Mosaic in the Lobby to open the door!
 
Right now, we are considering enchanting the door to only admit
Occultists, and we have not yet translated the mosaic...
 
Still yours, Karyn.

"Rituals of the Occult", By Erhon Lucoster (Page 13)
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha draws herself up
straight, taking deep, slow breaths. She extends two fingers, slowly
pressing them against her forehead, then her navel, then each shoulder.
 
Philosopher Martok Shiva, Student Of The Occult says, "Karyn.. are you
prepared?"
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Ateh malkuth, ve
geburah, ve gedulah, le olahm, amen!"
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "I do hope so!"
 
Philosopher Martok Shiva, Student Of The Occult bows low form the waist
and touches his index finger to his heart, forehead and shoulders.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha claps her hands together
as she finishes the Kabbalistic Cross. Walking to the eastern wall of
the cavern, she traces a pentagram in the air with her fingertip. She
draws her hand back momentarily, then thrusts it into the centre of the
star, firmly stating 'Yod Heh Vau Heh!'
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha steps to the southern
side of the garden, holding her hand before her as she traces a long
curve along the way. As she faces the wall, she draws another pentagram,
this time with a shout of 'Adonai!' as she thrusts her hand into it.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha takes a deep breath as
she traces the curve over to the western door. Tracing yet another star
there, she finishes it with an 'Eheieh!' before turning to the northern
wall, the pentagram there completed with a cry of 'Agla!' With a deep
breath, she returns to the east, completing the circle.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Before me, Buul!
Behind me, Skyrax! On my right hand, Dameron! On my left, Pyradius!
Before me flames the Pentagram, and in the column shines the Six-Rayed
Star!" Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha claps her hands
firmly,then turns back to the assembled people.
 
Philosopher Martok Shiva, Student Of The Occult makes the sign of the
five.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Now, I thank you
all for coming!"
  
Philosopher Martok Shiva, Student Of The Occult stamps his left foot
three times.
 
Crucible De'Veris says, "..M"lady would be pleased.."
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "We are come here
today for two reasons - First, to offer our fondest thanks to the Lady
Eris, who has guided us and watched over us for so many years. Second,
to welcome Valnurana, Lady of Dreams. Long may She bless us and keep
us!"

Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha now turns to gaze into
the cyclopian mirror, in which is reflected several bizarre and
dreamlike images, most notably a circle of blue flame, punctuated by
four burning pentacles, surrounding the room. Pressing her hands
together, she bows low to each of the stone images on either side.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "May I ask everyone
to join me in a 'Hail Eris!'"
 
*Much hailing of Eris done by the gathered Occultists*
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "And Hail, Lady
Valnurana!"
 
*Extreme hailing of Valnurana here*
 
Liberator of Orphans, Nolar D'Ischai-Rybnik, Chaotic Bard says, "Good
thing you didn't ask us to SHOUT these."
  
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Another Burning
Time if we did, I'd guess!"
 
Kronis says, "Well we coulda screamed."
 
Karyn nods her head at herself.
 
Martok grows still and his lips begin to move silently.
 
Kronis screams, "HAIL LADY VALNURANA!"
 
Leisel's Leezard, Krathnas "Pull my Tail" Xanatov says, "Let's not
forget the other Divine who has showed interest in helping our guild."
 
Kronis snuggles himself with a warm, happy, smile.
 
The Enigmatic Glyc Van Helsing, Lorekeeper says, "Hail the deathgod,
Hail Thoth."
 
Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac, the Drunk says to Karyn,
"Beautiful ceremony."

Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac, the Drunk says to you, "And
beautiful mirror."
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "And many thanks to
Erhon, by the way, for having this Mirror crafted for us. Now, as the
Principia Discordia tells us, each person looks at the world through
their own lenses, each one distorted in their own personal way. This
mirror is hopefully much clearer than any set of eyes - however, we of
course could hardly comprehend everything it shows us straight away."
 
Karyn's mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Thus, this mirror
has been crafted for us to gain a glimpse straight at as much Chaos as
we can take in one go - a sort of waking dream, if you will."
 
Karyn nods her head at herself.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Now then..."
 
*Karyn proceeds to hand out a tumbler to each person gathered*
 
Flair drains the last dregs of absinthe from a glass.
 
Karyn flaps her arms madly.
 
Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac, the Drunk says, "My tolerance
is soooo down."
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Dun drink them
just yet!"
 
"Eek!" Flair shouts in fright.
 
Karyn peers about herself unscrupulously.
 
Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac, the Drunk says, "I couldn't
help it."
 
Flair shuffles his feet uneasily.
 
Karyn gives a glass tumbler to Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac,
the Drunk.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "That's it, now!"
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha sets one more tumbler
down at her feet, then raises another up in both hands.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Lady Eris and Lady
Valnurana, I ask thee to bless this libation." Karyn turns and begins
gently pouring the drink over the mirror's surface.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Let it represent
each of our Patrons - The hallucinations, Lady Eris. The restful sleep
which will surely come after, Lady Valnurana. And the horrid hangovers
and promises to never do something like this again, Sartan!"
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha picks up her glass and
raises it up. 'Hail Eris, Hail Valnurana, and our thanks to each of the
Chaos Lords present now!
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Drink up!"
 
Crazy Inkwielder, Dirgmal Relkatha says, "I'll drink to that!"
 
Karyn's mouth turns up as her face breaks into a smile.
 
Liberator of Orphans, Nolar D'Ischai-Rybnik, Chaotic Bard says, "Hear
Hear!"
 
Dirgmal begins to wield a glass tumbler in his left hand.
 
Karyn drains the last dregs of absinthe from a glass.
 
Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac, the Drunk raises his glass in
praise
of Lady Eris and Lady Valnurana, and just a bit for Lord Dagon.
 
*Everyone downs their drinks like drunkards*
 
As you knock back the absinthe, it tears across your tongue with its
bitter flavor, as the back of your mouth tightens and a grimace spreads
across your face.
 
Orklanishkal wipes the back of his hand across his brow in relief.
 
"Oooooooooh!" Kronis says, eyes wide with wonder.
 
Dirgmal rubs his tummy and goes 'mmmmmmmm.'
 
Orklanishkal says, "Hear hear!"
 
The Enigmatic Glyc Van Helsing, Lorekeeper says, "That's some crazy
stuff..."
 
Liberator of Orphans, Nolar D'Ischai-Rybnik, Chaotic Bard says, "To
tumbler Ahh, AbStinthe, the grandest HallucinatIOns I've eveI had were
with you!"
 
Tough 'n Fluffy Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac, the Drunk says, "Yeah, good
sstuff."
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha turns back to the mirror
and bows to each of the statues again, with another round of hailings.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "As we open our
arms to
VaLnurana, let us continue to hold Lady Eris close to our hearts!"
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha walks back around the
room, undoing each of the pentagrams in a similar way as how she drew
them.
 
Awen Shirreyder Aitionn, Karyn Siowan Relkatha says, "Aside frod that,
now... Thanks very much to everyonee for coming, and take care!"

The Chamber of Obsidian.

This huge, cavernous room, completely carved out of obsidian, leaves no
doubt in your mind that you have walked into the realm of absolute
darkness. The obsidian floor, walls and ceiling have been brushed so as
not to reflect, but rather absorb light. Every sound seems muted, as
though sinking into the rock. An enormous throne is set against the back
wall, its sprawling mass impressive even in the grandeur of the chamber.
The presence of the Dark Lord is nearly tangible, radiating outwards
from the throne, and infecting all in its presence with the
inevitability of its dominance. No ornaments cover the walls, directing
the onlooker's gaze to the throne. In the centre of the east wall are
large double doors, carved of blackish wood. The only other feature in
the room is an effigy of the Lord of Intrigue and Deception, standing
over two manheights in a corner of the chamber. Darkness creeps over the
room, seemingly radiating from a massive granite altar. There are 2
chimeras here. A pathfinder bobs about in a circle, flexing its long
wiry antennae. Flair's Love Slave Jozlyn ShivaVan Helsing D'Ischai is
here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand. Xeph's Little
Princess, Nari Lucoster is here. She wields an arrow in her left hand.
Prophet of Babel, Flair D'IschaiSaer'rac is here. He wields a tower
shield in his left hand and ugly white granny panties in his right.
Principessa Valia AgraziaD'Ischai is here. She wields a tower shield in
her left hand and a yellow lily in her right. Father Reznik Trismegistus
is riding on a chimera. He wields a gleaming scimitar in his right hand.
Chaos Chef Das Rousseau is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his
left hand.

You see a single exit leading east (closed door).

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "There are shadows and apparitions that
might come visit at some point. If so, just keel em quickly... they
shouldn't cause ritual problems."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Er. If they attack."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Any questions before I start?"

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight says, "Nay."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'IschaiSaer'rac says to Reznik, "Could you just
maybe speak a bit about what you're doing first, for those not familiar
with kabbalism?"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Of course."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "What we will be doing is simply put an
ascension to Binah, a sephira of the Kabbalistic Tree of Existence."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "This is what is called a "low magick"
ritual in that it focuses more on physical result."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "I will be performing a ritual to
attempt to allow me to project my consciousness to the shadows in the
same location of a specified target."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "This makes it useful to not have the
whole active guild here."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "I will now begin."

Father Reznik Trismegistus steps boldly in front of the altar. He turns
to face the west.

Father Reznik Trismegistus bows his head. He breathes in and out slowly
and deeply.

Father Reznik Trismegistus raises his arms outwards, palms out, to
approximately shoulder height.

Father Reznik Trismegistus snaps his head up, his eyes focused at where
the horizon would be were you above ground.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Salutation and praise unto thee, O
darkenkindling Noxtra, child of Lord Twilight!"

As Reznik speaks the words of praise, brilliant motes of darkfire
encircle the ritual area.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "O thou lone allseeing Eye of the vault
celestial! Extend thy darkness that I be blessed, But dim thy glory that
I be not cursed."

Darkness suddenly descends on the ritual area, and you find it difficult
to see.

A few moments pass, and the Darkness is lifted.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Unmask thy countenance, O God of
Darkness: For I am a lover of Knowledge And I would behold the spiritual
essence concealed by thy dark disk!"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "So reveal unto my perception Thy
glorious and inmost nature, Even that high spirit which infuses thee And
is one with the primal darkfire Of mine own being."

Your mind reels as you almost touch the Ineffable Infinity of Eyn Sof!

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "O darkenkindling Noxtra, Child of Lord
Twilight: Salutation and praise unto thee!"

The motes of darkfire intensify around you, solidifying in a brilliant
shaft of purple light which shoots up from the altar.

A mote of purple darkfire hangs over the area, twinkling enigmatically.

All around you, the shadows whisper sibilant sighs of adoration.

Father Reznik Trismegistus lowers his head slowly, an almost
imperceptible smile on his face.

Feelings of tranquility, comfort, and serenity surround you as you revel
in the Infinite Darkness of Eyn Sof.

Reznik has successfully completed the Ritual of Adoration.

Father Reznik Trismegistus lowers his arms to his sides, lifts up his
head, and exhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus turns to the east and kneels.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "EI."

As Reznik chants the word of power, a tongue of darkfire materializes
above your head.

Father Reznik Trismegistus raises his arms into the Tau posture.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "HE BASILEIA."

As Reznik chants the words of power, a shaft of brilliant darkfire
shoots through the flame above your head and the center column of your
body to the ground between your feet.

Father Reznik Trismegistus touches his right shoulder with his left
palm.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "KAI HE DUNAMIS."

Father Reznik Trismegistus touches his left shoulder with his right
palm.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "KAI HE DOXA."

Father Reznik Trismegistus bows his head, a sheen of perspiration on his
face.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "EIS TOUS AIONAS."

As Reznik chants the words of power, the shaft of darkfire within you
begins to radiate energy and warmth throughout your entire being. Reznik
has successfully performed the Ritual of Calyx.

Sparkles of darkfire dance in front of you.

Father Reznik Trismegistus extends his arms out in front of him, palms
upraised, elevated slightly.

Father Reznik Trismegistus slowly turns a full circle counterclockwise,
ending up facing east once again.

Father Reznik Trismegistus lowers his arms and turns counterclockwise to
face westward. He then raises his arms over his head, palms out, and
stamps his right foot once.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "PROCUL ESTE, PROFANI!"

As Reznik chants the words of power, a ray of power begins emanating
from the darkfire above you.

This ray becomes a spiral descending around you, counterclockwise and
vanishes into the ground at your feet.

Father Reznik Trismegistus folds his arms on his chest, right over left.

A wall of darkfire, purple with silver sparkles, suddenly springs into
existence in the eastern portion of the area.

The wall of darkfire begins to expand northwestward.

Father Reznik Trismegistus turns counterclockwise to face eastward once
more. He raises his arms as before. He turns a full circle
counterclockwise.

Before long, it has completely encircled you.

All undesirable and unbalanced forces have been banished from your
circle.

The very air changes, feeling cooler and cleaner.

Father Reznik Trismegistus folds his arms over his chest, left over
right.

A wall of darkfire, mistblue with golden sparkles, suddenly springs into
existence in the western portion of the area.

The wall of darkfire begins to expand southeastward.

Before long, it has completely encircled you.

Reznik has successfully performed the Circle of Darkfire.

The air shimmers with dark power.

Father Reznik Trismegistus moves to the eastern boundary of the circle.
Beginning at this point, he begins to walk a slow counterclockwise
circle around the ritual area, his lamen dangling from its chain from
his outstretched hand, swinging back and forth slowly.

Father Reznik Trismegistus completes his circle and returns to the
center of the ritual area, facing east.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "HE PELEIA KAI HE HUGRA, HO OPHIS KAI
TO OIN."

A shimmering wall of silver mist suddenly springs into existence in the

Another pentagram of brilliant darkfire materializes on your forehead.

Father Reznik Trismegistus forms a triangle with his hands and holds it
to his forehead.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "ATHANATOS."

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "THEOS."

The pentagram is thrust southward by the force of the incantation.

As it comes into contact with the mist curtain, it diffuses into the
mist in a burst of darkfire.

The forces of fire are banished from the circle, and the fourth ward is
established.

Father Reznik Trismegistus faces east and rises into the Tau posture.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "GAIA KAI HO ICHOR TOU OURANOU."

You gain the power of shadow vision!

With it, you notice four beings materialize on the border ethereal
plane.

One is tall and slender, clad in a voluminous and billowing robe of
yellow highlighted with traces of violet.

A cool rushing of wind begins to come from the east.

Father Reznik Trismegistus raises his arms to the heavens, palms facing
upward.

The second is a lean muscular figure with an appearance of great
strength standing amid flames. It is clad in a robe of brilliant red
with changing sparks of green. In its right hand it holds a wand of
burnished copper.

A sensation of powerful heat begins to emanate from the south.

The third being is a tall and powerful figure. The being stands amid
foaming and turbulent waters, clad in a robe of blue and highlights of
orange. In its left hand, it holds a silver cup.

You begin to feel the mighty surge of the sea tides pouring in
successive waves from the west.

The fourth being is a broadshouldered and placid figure. It is robed in
indigo that gleams with flashes of pale gold and it stands upon wild
grass studded with yellow flowers. In its left hand, the figure bears a
golden orb; in its right a golden sickle.

A feeling of great peace and stability begins to radiate from the north.

Reznik completes his ritual! You are now protected by wards of power!

Your shadow vision fades but you still sense the four dark beings
guarding your magick circle.

Motes of darkfire sparkle about you.

Father Reznik Trismegistus faces east and stands tall, hands at his
sides.

Father Reznik Trismegistus inhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "EN TO PAN."

A sphere of intense purple darkfire materializes above your head.

The soothing darkfire fills and warms the space above you.

A sphere of purple darkfire coalesces upon your forehead.

The darkfire permeates your head and it begins to glow warm, healing
flames.

Father Reznik Trismegistus exhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "TURANA."

A sphere of intense purple darkfire materializes outside of your body,
in front of your throat.

The soothing darkfire bathes your throat and upper chest with darkness.

Your breathing relaxes.

Your lungs and throat move more freely, relaxed but strong.

Father Reznik Trismegistus inhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "DESTAPHITON."

A sphere of intense purple darkfire materializes at your chest, half in
and half out of your body.

The soothing flames fill your chest, healing and warming you.

It gives darkness to the blood that flows through your heart.

The darkness is distributed through your body by the strong and sure
movements of your circulation.

Father Reznik Trismegistus exhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "ONOPHIS."

A sphere of intense purple darkfire materializes at your groin.

You feel the darkfire warm you.

As darkness awakens this energy center, it clears blockages and floods
your body with health and strength.

You feel sensual and erotic as this power center connects to the awesome
strength of darkness within you.

Father Reznik Trismegistus inhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "IAO."

A sphere of intense purple darkfire materializes between your feet, half
above the ground, half below.

The sphere shines upwards from the ground.

Its movements warm your lower body, lazily stirring it like a pool of
water.

Father Reznik Trismegistus exhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus inhales.

Father Reznik Trismegistus chants, "BATHMENINHEKASTOU."

A thick band of sparkling purple fire rises from between your feet.

It spirals counterclockwise, moving swiftly around your body.

The darkfire continues to spiral until it reaches the sphere in front of
your throat, where it is absorbed.

A thick band of crimson fire rises from between your feet, spiraling
clockwise.

It moves swiftly around your body until it is also absorbed.

You are refreshed and energized by the Citadel of Darkness.

The air shimmers with sparkles of darkfire.

Father Reznik Trismegistus slips the lamen over his head once more and
lowers his head, breathing in and out deeply a moment.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Malkuth. Representative of tangible
reality, solidity, stability, that which we can see and touch guide us
this day."

Father Reznik Trismegistus kneels before the altar to press his lamen
against the stone floor, lingering there a moment before rising to his
feet once more.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Yesod. Keeper of the Treasure House of
Images, your vision leads us to understand that which we see. Help us
understand, and become more than flesh. Guide us this day."

Father Reznik Trismegistus lifts the pendant of his lamen to his
forehead, pressing it against where the spiritual third eye is said to
be.

High Sorceress, Lavinia, the Prestidigitator shouts, "Azzie, get your
behind here now please."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Glorious Hod, creator of Visions of
Splendour. May we learn to reason and communicate to others what we see,
understand what we are shown. Guide us this day."

You feel lighter and more ethereal.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Gevurah, the Mighty. Empower us to
take that which we have come to know and act on it. Grant us strength to
clear that which opposes us. Guide us this day."

Father Reznik Trismegistus lowers his hand slightly and begins to hold
the pentagram within a clenched fist.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Binah, old woman of understanding. You
teach us that everything has an opposing force for every reason to live,
there is a reason to die. And while I seek to take on a shadowy form and
convey my words to others in guise, we must be saddened that they know
not the true voice of the Father. I beseech of Thee, aid me this day
help me take on this guise so that others may know my voice but not my
name, hear my words sent from afar. Send me in guise to Diminish, so
that she may hear me and look upon the mask of Darkness!"

Father Reznik Trismegistus releases the lamen and holds the pentagram
above his heart.

Father Reznik Trismegistus begins to concentrate on seperating mind from
body, insulating one from the other for a time.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Diminish has left the realms... may
the mask be sent instead to Miric, so that he may look upon the Mask and
hear us."

The air begins to shimmer and a shadowy simulacrum appears in the area.

It nods and hurtles into an unseen portal.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Tell Miric to look upon the Mask of
Darkness and tell his guild what he sees."

Father Reznik Trismegistus breathes in and out slowly, focusing all of
his will and concentration on the ritual at hand.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Simulacrum, you may return from whence
you came. Thank You for your aid."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Thank you, Binah. In darkness you have
guided us, and the words sent were true."

Father Reznik Trismegistus takes the lamen in his fist once more.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Thank you, Gevurah. Action occurred
with your aid, and no obstacle bound us."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Thank you, Hod, for granting us the
clarity of thought to carry out our will."

Father Reznik Trismegistus presses the lamen to his forehead once more.

You begin to become more substantial and solid.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Thank you, Yesod. Our sight was true
this day."

(Occultists): Miric says, "Well, that was.... weird."

Father Reznik Trismegistus hangs the lamen before his eyes.

(Occultists): You say, "What was?"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Thank you, Malkuth, for providing a

Father Reznik Trismegistus exhales slowly, wiping sweat from his brow.

(Occultists): Miric says, "Then I kinda got the sense that whoever it
was was trying to pull something on me, then poof, it vanished."

Xeph's Little Princess, Nari Lucoster says, "That was amazing."

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight says, "Indeed."

(Occultists): Miric says, "Some magic or something, anyway. Not sure
what."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'IschaiSaer'rac says, "It was beautiful."

Flair's Love Slave Jozlyn ShivaVan Helsing D'Ischai says, "Glorious."

(Occultists): Reznik says, "That was the result of the ritual we just
undertook."

(Occultists): Reznik says, "I sent a messenger to you."

(Occultists): Miric says, "Ah. Whelp, as I said, I didn't see a thing.
Got plenty freaked out, but I didn't see anything."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Allright. What are your thoughts?"

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight asks, "If you don't mind telling
us, what were those rare circumstances?"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Conditions for a ritual are not always
right. If one undertakes a ritual under lessthandesirable circumstances,
the chance of error grows..."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "And errors in this type of work are at
best fatal."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "I really don't want to be dragged off
by a qlippah, thank you very much."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Anyone else?"

Chaos Chef Das Rousseau says, "Well, what was meant by the turning in
each direction."

Chaos Chef Das Rousseau says, "That seemed pretty important."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Basically, everything I did up until I
began invoking the individual sephira was erecting wards."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Wards offer some protection against
malevolent entities."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "When you weaken the planar fabric
between this plane and another..."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "You run the risk of Very Bad Things
coming."

Xeph's Little Princess, Nari Lucoster raises her hand.

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "The directions are all symbolic, and
correspond to different entities and protections."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says to Nari, "Go ahead."

Xeph's Little Princess, Nari Lucoster says, "What plane did they come
from?"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "They come from the Unseen. To say it
is a plane is simplifying it a bit... it's kind of hard to explain. I'd
suggest checking our guild library for a better idea of what the Unseen
is."

You say, "What were the actual prerequisit conditions for the ritual?"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "I'm afraid I can't discuss the
prerequisite conditions for the ritual."

You tell Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight, "Good show by the way."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Any other questions?"

Xeph's Little Princess, Nari Lucoster says, "I have more."

Xeph's Little Princess, Nari Lucoster says, "One more."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "Allright, ask away."

Xeph's Little Princess, Nari Lucoster says, "Does our guild have
writings on those names you talked about like.. the different guides."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "We do indeed."

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight says, "I recall the name Malkuth
from somewhere."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "The "guides" you refer to are sephira,
ten of which make up the Kabbalistic Tree of Existence."

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight says, "Not the person, mind you."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "I'm pretty sure I've seen it elsewhere
as well but I can't recall where."

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight asks, "What language was that?"

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "It's a Dark language."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'IschaiSaer'rac says, "If I may, the alphabet
is a strong magic in it's own right, in may traditions."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'IschaiSaer'rac says, "So language can be very
important, depending on the type of ritual you are doing in."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'IschaiSaer'rac says, "And please forgive my
mispronunciations."

Baron Glyc Van Helsing, Bastion Knight says, "Can you tell us about Eyn
Sof."

Father Reznik Trismegistus says, "The Eyn Sof, Ain Soph, or however you
choose to label it is the same as the Unseen."

The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus says, "I've been given a
briefing, but I'd like to know more, if it's not too late."

Gregg Saer'rac says, "Erhon... its yer idea care to elaborate?"

You say, "We were talking about the Haunting idea.. I figured it'd be a
good idea if we checked to make sure there were vengeful spirits who
wanted to do what we had planned."
 
Flair nods his head emphatically.
  
You say, "So I suggested holding a seance.. to try and contact them."
 
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus says, "Very nice."
 
Gregg nods his head at you.
  
You say, "Hmm.. so who wants to be a point in my circle?"
 
Gregg Saer'rac grins widely, stretching nearly ear to ear.
  
Gregg Saer'rac says, "I wills."
  
You give a grey candle to Gregg Saer'rac.
 
Blujixapug Lucoster says, "Me, too."
  
You give a grey candle to Blujixapug Lucoster.
 
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus says, "If you need me, I will."
 
Surt nods his head emphatically.
 
Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "I will too if needed."

You give a grey candle to Drake Sigao Saer'rac.
 
Gregg Saer'rac steps over towards the mirror, crossing his legs to sit
in the lotus position. Back facing the mirror.

You give a white candle to The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus.
 
Gregg Saer'rac says, "Hmm, ifs ya want me somewhere else ofs course.
Just say somethin."
 
Gregg sits down.
 
Blujixapug stretches languidly.
 
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus sits down next to Gregg.
 
Flair sits down.
 
Erhon nods to Gregg, then points Sigao, Blu, and Flair into positions
creating a rough circle.

The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus scoots over, making another
point in the circle.
 
Drake Sigao Saer'rac moves to the position indicated by Flair and sits,
quietly.
 
Sigao sits down.
  
Approximately twelve inches in length, this incense stick has a
distinctly
pleasant smell to it. One would be hard pressed to identify the exact
nature of
the smell though. The scent brings to mind memories and impressions of
long ago
rituals. And it serves as a reminder of many a historic occult
experiment, in
which such incense was used to mask other, less appealing odors.
It has 24 months of usefulness left.
It weighs 6 ounce(s).
 
Reznik closes his eyes and bows his head.
  
Blujixapug Lucoster sits on the other side of Gregg, completing the
circle.
 
Erhon moves around the circle, dragging an incense stick behind and
watching as it leaves a marked line in it's wake, creating the outline
of the circle and filling the room with the soft fragrance of the stick.
  
Gregg Saer'rac tilts his head back to stare upwards towards the ceiling,
inhaling and exhaling deeply.
 
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus crosses his arms in front of
his chest, head bowed.
  
Blujixapug Lucoster begins to breathe calmly and deeply, his eyes
unmoving and focused on a distant point.

Erhon continues along, eventually finishing the circle and filling it in
with a pentagram, each point terminating at one of the Occultists
sitting around the circle. Each sector is marked with a different rune,
each a sigil to a different power for protection. Within the center of
the star a larger symbol is made.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac Closes his eyes and sits upright. He breathes
deeply, through his diaphram, holds it, and exhales slowly.
 
Erhon moves to the head of of the circle and looks down, judging the
work and nods slightly before taking his seat.

You say, "Light your candles."

The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus lights his white candle.
 
Sigao begins to wield a grey candle in his left hand.

Erhon lights his candle and puts it at the point of the star before him.

Gregg Saer'rac sparks his grey candle and lights it. He sets the candle
in front of him resting it on his point of the circle.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac lights his grey candle.
 
Sigao ceases to wield a grey candle in his left hand.

Blujixapug Lucoster holds a piece of flint to his candle and strikes a
spark.
His second attempt to strike creates a spark which catches, lighting the
grey
candle he holds.

Blujixapug Lucoster places his candle at the point near which he sits.
 
Drake Sigao Saer'rac sets his candle before him, in it's proper place.

Erhon takes a deep breath and holds it in, closing his eyes a second
before opening them again with the outtake of breath.

Erhon moves his hands infront of him, tracing a sigil in the air before
him. "And it begins."

Blujixapug Lucoster stares down at his candle, focusing on the
flickering flame.

The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
Blujixapug's candle sputter's a brief instant, the flame quickly
steadies itself.
 
Erhon traces another set of Sigils before him. "Lord Aeon, allow us to
speak with those that have been lost by your travels, those that past
before us and now walk the sunless realms. Lord Thoth, allow us to
breach the veil between our planes so that those souls who live in your
domain might speak with us now. The Gods that watch over us now, protect
us as we search out those we would call lost kin, Lady Makali the
Destroyer, Lady Valnurana the Dreamer, Lady Eris the Sower of Discord,
and Lord Twilight, the encompassing Darkness, protect us and aide us in
this endeavor.
  
Khalil slowly fades into view, returning to the realm of perception.
 
Gregg Saer'rac nods his head slightly, closing his eyes as he focuses on
his candle. He moves his palms to the points of the circle facing
inwards to his circle.

You say, "Focus on the Flames.. Call to the lost children of the
Occult.. let them remember who they once were and cast off the lethargy
of passing time.."

Drake Sigao Saer'rac sinks into a state of deep concentration while his
candle flickers before him.

Blujixapug Lucoster again stares down to focus on his candle, this time
closing his eyes as he does so. His breathing slows, and his body
relaxes.
 
Reznik grows still and his lips begin to move silently.
 
With a flourish of his arm, Reznik bows deeply.
 
Gregg nods his head at Reznik.
  
Reznik is enveloped in translucent fire for a moment and is gone, his
soul safe until he returns to Achaea.
 
Starwashed Incubus, Surt Ta'sa, Fiddler of Discord bows his head and
relaxes his eyes on the flames of each candle, eager to see what is to
come.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac chants, "Charred souls of the burning times, hear
us in this circle. Remember the rage, remember the fear induced by your
oppressors and come help us, your distant children."

You say, "We call to you.. those that were lost to us in ages long
gone... hear us and come."
   
Blujixapug Lucoster says, "Disciples of the lost cabals... let the light
beckon your wandering spirits..."
 
Gregg Saer'rac chants, "Awaken froms the eternal slumber... hear our
calls oh tortured spirits."

The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus waves his hand over the flame
of his candle and says, "To us, those who have been lost."
 
The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
You feel a faint breeze against your face, bringing a cooling damp air
with it.

You say, "Someone comes... though are they who we call...?"

Blujixapug Lucoster takes a slow breath and mumbles something hard to
hear... 'Victims of the Burning Times, hear our request.'

Drake Sigao Saer'rac chants, "Come, spirits, through any veil that may
separate, and make your presence known."
 
The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
The breeze strengthens, its accompanied by a mounting charnel smell.
 
Gregg wrinkles his nose and sniffs.
 
Flair winces in pain.
  
Blujixapug Lucoster opens his eyes and wrinkles his nose, but his gaze
steadies on the candle in front of him. 'We beckon you, Occultists of
the past...'
 
Ward of Chaos, Khalil D'IschaiSaer'rac holds a finger across his nose,
attempting to block the invading smell.

Blujixapug Lucoster says, "We seek to give you an oppurtunity... and to
communicate with you, if you would have us do so."
 
A soft, whispery sigh breathes through the underground garden.
 
The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
A raspy voice whispers from the middle of the circle,
...flames....burn...
 
Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Is it your wish, venerable spirits, to gain
vengaence on those that inflicted this punishment upon you?"
  
Blujixapug Lucoster says, "The Times of Burning are long past..."
  
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus says, "But not forgotten."
 
Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Aye, not by your Occultic brothers, but the
church's memory is fading."
   
You say, "We appologize for waking you no and reminding you of the
pain.. Our thoughts were of allowing you vengence if you willed and why
we called you forth now. If you will it, we will aid you now, to balance
the scales and allow you some measure of peace."
 
The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
The candles flare high towards the ceiling, and slowly recede. Casting
long shadows against the wall.
  
Drake Sigao Saer'rac looks intently into the center of the circle.
 
The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
A multitude of raspy voices call out, ...now...you see ... we always....

You say, "Then it is your will that we proceed?"
  
The reflective surface of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its
thriceblessed power is called upon.
 
The voices continue, ... we... anything... stop flame
  
Blujixapug Lucoster winces at the word 'flame', but glances across to
Erhon, waiting for him to speak.
  
Gregg nods his head at Blujixapug.
  
You say, "Return to oblivions embrace our Kin.. forget the pain of the
flame for now, await us and we shall claim that which is rightfully
yours in time, return to the dream until the nightmare can be broken. We
swear to you, we shall give you peace at last."
  
Erhon moves his hand over the candle's flame and closes his fist,
extinguishing the flame. "Thank you."
  
Drake Sigao Saer'rac opens his eyes, and blows out his candle.
 
Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Thank you noble spirits."
 
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus looks to Gregg and then to
Erhon and whispers, "Revenge."
 
Gregg Saer'rac says, "Rest well spirits, we'll extinquish the flames."
 
Blujixapug Lucoster leans forward and blows out his candle.
 
The Prophet of Babel, Flair Trismegistus picks up his dead candle and
rolls it gently in his hands.

Flair gives Gregg a compassionate hug.
 
Durgan has been slain by the might of a mysterious cloaked figure.

in a spark of magic.
 
A shimmering, translucent image rises up before you, its glittering
surface displaying the verdant grasslands, soaring mountains, sprawling
settlements and deep blue seas of the Achaea mainland.
 
Flair reaches out and touches the map, and melts effortlessly into the
image.
Flair leaves to the ether.
  
The shimmering map folds up and vanishes into the ether.
 
Blujixapug Lucoster says, "Oops, he left..."
  
Blujixapug bows respectfully to a large silvered mirror.
 
Sigao bows respectfully to a large silvered mirror.
 
Blujixapug stretches languidly.
  
Gregg Saer'rac asks you, "Why do I always end up in the scary rituals?"
 
Sigao flashes Gregg a joyous smile.
 
Erhon moves his hand in a sweeping motion and smears the circle, holding
his hand on the center and pushing all the remaining energy into the
ground.

You yawn suddenly and mightily.
 
You say, "Beats us trying to burn you?"

Blujixapug Lucoster says, "Hmm."

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Man, did that voice freak anyone else out?"

Gregg nods his head at Sigao.

Gregg shudders violently.

Sigao wraps a comforting arm around Gregg.

Shaded Corner in Underground Garden.
A comforting feeling of privacy pervades the area. You have left the
fountain behind and come to rest in this corner. Under an ivy-covered
trellis a number of wide stone seats are placed in a circle, with soft
velvet cushions to allow Occultists to talk and greet each other in
peace. The faint flow of the fountain can still be heard, and you can
detect the sounds of the city filtering down, citizens going about their
business without any hint of knowledge of this hidden headquarters.
Sitting back on one of the benches, you contemplate the beauty of this
hidden grove, and wish more could witness it. A large silvered mirror
surrounded by two statues stands here. A runic totem is planted solidly
in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is
on the ground. Erhon Lucoster is here. Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of
Lights is here. He wields a
steel shortsword in his left hand. Right Hand of the Revolution,
Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul is here. He wields a cavalry shield bearing the
city arms of Ashtan in his left hand and an obsidian dagger in his
right. Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac is here. Drake Sigao
Saer'rac is here. Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac is here. She
wields a simple fishing pole in her left hand.
You see a single exit leading west.

You see the following people here:
Orklanishkal, Sigao, Gorax, Khalil, Erhon, Brigitte, Gregg

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Should I wait for Erhon to
return, or...?"

You say, "Yeah."

You say, "Buts be ready wit what yer gunna say!"

Sigao gives a pained sigh.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "What was it... two months
ago, now, that I found a surving copy of Revelations of Glaaki... so
Gregg and I looked through it, and found one page in particular that
caught our eyes. This page seemed to entail some sort of ritual, so we
worked to translate it... and so, now, we'll attempt to recreate it."

Gregg waves a yellowed piece of parchment in his paw.

"Oooooooooh!" Orklanishkal says, eyes wide with wonder.

You ask, "Rights then, is everybody ready?"

Khalil nods his head emphatically.

Brigitte nods her head emphatically.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights says, "What do I have to do?"

Sigao yawns suddenly and mightily.

You say, "Rights now, everybody gather in a circle."

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul shuffles slowly to a
spot in
the circle.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac moves to a point along the imaginary circle and
stands.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights moves into position in the circle.

Gregg takes his spot in the circle standing beside Khalil.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac walks over to his chosen spot in
the circle, and stands silently.

Erhon Lucoster moves to another spot around the circle and stretches his
back and rolls his neck, popping it a few times.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac moves to a place in the circle,
watching intently.

Gregg waves a piece of black chalk, before he bends down to draw a
circle. He shuffles slowly along the floor drawing the edge inches away
from your feet.

Gregg inscribes a strange seven pointed star in the midst of the circle.
Drawing each point facing a ritualist, having finished the symbol he
walks casually to his point at the circle.

You say, "Wit this ritual we hopes to contact Glaaki himself..."

You say, "Please everybody focus yer thoughts on the hyms ya already
know to sing to him..."

You say, "Dun'ts say them outloud mind ya..."

Drake Sigao Saer'rac closes his eyes and concentrates, moving his lips
silently.

Sigao yawns suddenly and mightily.

Erhon Lucoster closes his eyes and concentrates on the hymn to raise the
mists, humming them slightly to himself.

Gregg gives his parchment the once over, mumbling softly to himself as
he does so.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac focuses on the center of the
star, and visualises a link to the Lords themselves.

Khalil closes his eyes.

Khalil begins to mutter strange incantations under his breath.

Khalil murmurs incoherently.

Gregg begins to chant loudly, his voice resounding in rythme with the
familiar hymn. The words seem somehow forbidden and sends a chill down
your back as he reads them.

Khalil lets out a ghastly wail.

Khalil opens his eyes and bows his head.

Your surroundings burst asunder, a gaping black void opening in front of
you. An eerie blue light begins to issue forth from the infinity of
empty space ahead of you, unfolding slowly into a doorway. Underneath
the calm humming that seems to emanate from the azure portal, you hear
faint echos the likes of which you have never before encountered.

Gregg continues his chant, switching to words in Achaean as he reads.

Erhon Lucoster continues to chant under his breath, keeping his eyes
closed to the room and concentrating on the hymn in his mind.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac keeps her eyes closed tightly, and
continues to mouth the words of the hymn to herself.
You say, "Lord Glaaki, we haves forged a link from this realm to
chaos... draw from this link and and make your presence known! We haves
offerings as well."

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac slowly and confidently walks to
the center of the circle, drops to one knee, and places a fish before
the portal.

Khalil drops a giant chubsucker.

Gregg contines his chant to the all too familiar hymm, again resounding
in that strange forbidden language.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The outline of the portal begins to waver, a high screeching begining to
sound through the room as a feeling of distortion washes through the
area.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac stands and turns to walk back to
his place in the circle.

Gregg winces slightly at the grating sound, but quickly resumes his
chant.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The clear image of Xenophage watching through his window back at the
gathered Occultists shatters, a snarl upon the Lords face as it falls
into a swirling nothingness that replaced him.

You chant, "Lord Glaaki, we welcome ya. Accept our offerin from the deep
to the deep again."

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The image swirls back though completely distorted, no shapes are seen on
the other side but vage outlines of gaping maws and eyes. The surface of
the portal ripples as a tentacle pushes through, an eye and a gaping maw
rowed with fangs slithers out towards the offered fish.

Sigao doubles over in pain, clutching his stomach.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

Wrapping around the fish, the gutteral sound of grunts and shrieking is
all that emanates from the portal.

Sigao doubles over in pain, clutching his stomach.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Lord Glaaki, I trust
that's a sign that you're pleased with our offering?"

Lunastra shines less brightly as her supremacy of the heavens begins to
abate.

Sigao doubles over in pain, clutching his stomach.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Lord Glaaki? We humbly ask
that You come forward and speak with us, if You will..."

Sigao takes a drink from a black-walnut vial.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

At Khalil's prompting the tentacle stops and pauses in midair, still
eatting but registering the young Tsol's presence.

Sigao's legs collapse under him as he suddenly passes out.

Being unconscious, Drake Sigao Saer'rac falls over.

Sigao regains consciousness with a start.

Sigao's legs collapse under him as he suddenly passes out.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac tilts his head slightly, and
takes a step forward, so as to make contact with the Lost Lord.

Sigao regains consciousness with a start.

Sigao stands up and stretches his arms out wide.

Gregg glances a concerned look to Sigao.

Sigao's legs collapse under him as he suddenly passes out.

Being unconscious, Drake Sigao Saer'rac falls over.

Sigao regains consciousness with a start.

Orklanishkal gives Sigao the once over.

Sigao stands up and stretches his arms out wide.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.
Gregg continues his chant, losing his spot in the circle as he reaches
forward trying to grab Khalil's arm.

Orklanishkal raises a tarot card over the head of Sigao. Upon releasing
it, it instantly expands and moves downward until his entire body has
been passed through it.

Orklanishkal gives Sigao the once over.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac closes her eyes tightly, chanting
furiously as to close the circle.

You exclaim, "Close the circle!"

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights grabs khalil around the waist and
begins pulling the other way.

Erhon Lucoster claps his hands together and begins chanting, moving his
hands in a complex gestures.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac kneels down and sings the end of the hymn to
Glaaki.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac opens her eyes, hearing the shuffle
and rushed over with Gorax, trying to pry Khalil free from the tentacle.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Let go of him... pleaaaaaase
let go of him!"

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Don't break the circle again, Brigitte, I
did enough damage by my fainting."

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

Three other tentacles flash through the portal, one wrapping around
Gregg's leg, another flailing about widely, and another clamping onto
Khalil's waste and helping drag the group towards the portal.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "We don't want another tentacle coming out,
just help close it."

Drake Sigao Saer'rac points his ringed finger at the tentacled mass.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac chants, "Glaaki, leave us now, take us no more."

It is now the 12th of Lupar, 370 years after the fall of the Selucarian
Empire.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac chants, "You are no longer welcome here."

Gregg cries out in pain, wincing at the tentacle as he tries to close
the circle.

Erhon Lucoster makes a grabbing motion towards the nearest person, which
happened to be Gorax, and his aura flares while he makes a forceful
gesture at the Portal, a small wave of force ensuing from the manuver
leaving both satyr and horkval drained, but to no effect against the
monster.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac continues to chant, tears rolling
down her face as she lets go and tries to concentrate to close the
circle.

Gregg instinctively draws a paw to a swan shaped symbol on his brow,
taking some small comfort in the charm.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac falters slightly as he starts to
lose consciousness from the lack of airflow, but continues to try to
fight the tentacle.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac makes a complicated set of hand gestures, in an
attempt to banish the tentacles.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The portal edges begin to vibrate, and the screaming grows louder as a
giant... it could only be described as a mouth approached and grew
clearer in the portal.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights pulls with what strength is left in
his body on the tentacle in an attempt to free Khalil of the tentacle.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac uses all his strength to remain standing and
cognizant, exhausted from his fits of fainting.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac makes one last, feeble attempt at
budging the tentacle before completely blacking out and going slack.

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul takes his dagger,
and attempts to slice the tentacle, hoping desperately to save Khalil.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The flailing tentacle makes a sweep of the room low, slamming everyone
to the ground.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights wraps his hand around the tentacle
and pours every ounce of chaotic energy he has into his warp.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac moves slowly up to a standing position, trying to
stand again.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Khalil! Noooooooooooo! LET
HIM GO DAMN YOU... LET HIM GO!"

Gregg sits up, but beyond that is only able to stare at the gaping maw
and tentacles. Unable to do anything but mutter to himself.
Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul attempts to stand
up, dazed from the fall.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights now only feebly pounds on the
tentacle drained completly.

Sigao doubles over in pain, clutching his stomach.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac shuffles to her feet, trying to
concentrate on the hymn.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The tentacle around Khalil's neck releases and then slams into Gorax for
the pain he caused.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

Gregg's tentacle begins to drag the rajamala towards the portal.

Ward of Chaos Khalil D'Ischai-Saer'rac slumps to the ground in an
undignified heap, mere feet from the portal.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights attpemts to crawl towards the
tentacle holding gregg.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights says, "You wont get any of them while
Im here."

Gregg scratches his paws into the ground, trying desperatly to keep from
losing ground.

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul tugs on Khalil's
arm, attempting to move him farther away from the portal.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights finally gains his footing and jumps
on top of the tentacle dragging Gregg.

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "Ow..."

Gorax's eyes repeatedly shut as he tries to stay awake.

Erhon Lucoster cuts his hand and starts bleeding, drawing a spiral on
the ground. "Destruction, I beg thee, come forward and remove the breech
between the veil between worlds, your child begs for your help."

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac reaches out as she sees Khalil fall,
trying to tug him away from the port and keep her place in the circle.

Erhon Lucoster slams the bloody palm into the symbol, focusing his
essence and will into breaking the stasis of reality and fracture the
portal.

Erhon Lucoster says, "GREGG HELP ME!"

Gregg closes his eyes and slows his breath, trying to regain compsure
despite the tentacle.

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights starts pounding on the Tentacle under
him, trying to get it to release Gregg.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac attempts despareately to help, but ends up only
fumbling weakly, and almost falling off his place in the circle.

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul jabs his dagger into
the tentacle capturing Gregg, to no avail.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

You say, "Lady of Sleep, please let the swan guide us to safety as it
did the first..."

The portal outline begins to waver, and recede, constricting the
tentacles and forcing two of the four to retreat into it.

The face of the silvered mirror flashes brightly as its thrice-blessed
power is called upon.

The tentacle around Gregg's leg releases and pulls back into the portal,
as well as the final one, though taking the unconscious form of Khalil
with it.
Khalil leaves to the ether.

Orklanishkal's eyes bug out as he boggles in amazement.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac exclaims, "NOOOOOOOO!!!!"

Gorax Flyingfire, Keeper of Lights says, "Nooooooo."

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "...shit."

Sigao blinks.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac falls to her knees in tears.

Sigao vomits up the contents of his stomach.

You blink.

Gorax slumps down dejectedly.

Orklanishkal strokes Brigitte's head in consolation.

Tears fill Sigao's eyes and begin to slowly run down his face.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Fuck."

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Khalilllllllllllllllllll...."

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "If I'd eaten before coming..."

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Fuck."

The shimmering map folds up and vanishes into the ether.

Drake Sigao Saer'rac says, "Can you give me one too?"

Rubbing your fingers briskly on the card, you charge it with necessary
energy.
The card begins to glow with a mystic energy.

You fling the card at the ground, and it vanishes into the earth in a
spark of magic.

A shimmering, translucent image rises up before you, its glittering
surface displaying the verdant grasslands, soaring mountains, sprawling
settlements and deep blue seas of the Achaea mainland.

Sigao reaches out and touches the map, and melts effortlessly into the
image.
Sigao leaves to the ether.

The shimmering map folds up and vanishes into the ether.

Erhon sits down.
Heaving a great sigh, you flop down upon the ground, defeated by the
world.

You say, "DAMNIT."

Erhon Lucoster holds his bleeding palm, staring at the floor a bit.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac raises her head, glancing between
Erhon and Gregg in total disbelief.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "What.. the hell ... just
happened?"
You say, "We screwed up..."
"Damn it!" you swear in frustration.
Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Why did it take
Khalil......."

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "WHY?!"

Orklanishkal arrives from the west.
You say, "I dunno."

Brigitte begins to weep uncontrollably.
Gregg hangs his head down in shame.

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "I couldn't
find him."

Brigitte shakes her head.
You say, "No, that portal didn'ts lead to the chaosrealm..."

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "It's my fault..."

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "I broke the circle.."

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "I thought it
had lead there..."

Orklanishkal gives a pained sigh.
You say, "No, I was the one helpin him translate that damn scroll."

Brigitte begins to weep uncontrollably.

Erhon Lucoster starts to pale a bit, clutching his palm to try and stop
the bleeding. "We stared into the maw of the beast.. and were
helpless....."

Orklanishkal shudders violently.
You say, "Maybes we can do it again..."
You say, "Next time we're be prepared."
You say, "Next time we're gets em back..."

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "..."

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "Or, someone
will die..."

Brigitte leans on Orklanishkal seeking consolation.
You say, "We cans get em back, I knows it."

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Daddy.. please take me out of
here.."
Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "I want out of this.."

Erhon Lucoster says, "So I die.. I want to at least have my little
brother here again."

You nod your head at Erhon.

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "You dying
won't bring your brother back."

You say, "Khalil was a damn good friend."

Orklanishkal nods his head emphatically.

Brigitte Eruu'Yul D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "You're talking about him like
he's dead! He's NOT dead! Daddy.. please take me out of here."

Brigitte begins to weep uncontrollably.

Erhon Lucoster closes his eyes as he gets paler... "I think.. I cut too
deeply.. this.. ti.." falls over unconscious.

You say to Brigitte, "We cans get em back, I knows... next time..."

Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal Eruu'Yul says, "I would hope
so."

Orklanishkal gives a pained sigh.

Orklanishkal beckons Brigitte to him.

Brigitte leaves, following Right Hand of the Revolution, Orklanishkal
Eruu'Yul.

Orklanishkal leaves to the west.

Gregg scoots closer to Erhon, taking his cut hand and tearing a strip
from his priest's robe.

Gregg holds the cloth against Erhon's cut, hoping to stop the bleeding.

You exclaim, "Ifs ya die, I wun'ts have anybody to beat up on!"

Erhon Lucoster groans and opens his eyes a bit, before sighing and
slumping into the floor, looking at the blood covering him. "I.. really
should.. find a better way.. to bleed myself."

You nod your head at Erhon.


"Rituals of the Occult", By Erhon Lucoster (Page 30)
A small Thoth ritual we were invited to witness.

Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "Then i shall begin."
 
Hypnos kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "My Lord..My Master. Here i am to
show my
devotion to you in words and actions. May this become a part of me, and
allow
me to better myself for you. So blessed be my Lord. This is for you."
  
Hypnos stands up and stretches his arms out wide.
 
Hypnos begins to wield a black candle in his left hand.
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "Here within my hands. Lies a
candle. It
shows my soul in this world. It stands strong and young, in this world
where i
have much to learn and to grow from."
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "And as it is lighten, its shows
my souls
time in this realm."
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "Yet before this, one thing about
the
candle must be noted. Its very color. The color of black, is the showing
of
Death. As my soul is now part of Lord Thoth, it bares the color. As
where many
its sign wrongly, i bare it proudly for all to see and view."
  
Hypnos takes the tinderbox and tenderly gets a flame up. He places the
candle
over it and lights the wick.
** Illusion **
  
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "The flame, means more than the
slowing
of my physical life. It shows my devotion. How it starts off as a small
flame,
where in time. it grows stronger and brighter with each passing day,
week,
year."

You sent the following message to Gregg: ... this is a devotional...

Hypnos ceases to wield a black candle in his left hand.
 
Gregg has just left you message #2183.
 
Message #2183       Sent by: Gregg
6/13/5:14 "I wanted to see some souls fly around!"
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "As i place the candle upon this
pentacle. It symbols of the very world i live on. Where i was birthed,
where i
live, and where my body will lie when my passing comes. The candle shows
how im
just one person out of many here."
 
You sent the following message to Gregg: How does he get three points
from a
pentacle?
  
Gregg has just left you message #2184.
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "My life is tied to this very
world. Its
because of it, im allowed to be here this moment. In turn to this world,
i am
here to praise and worship one of its parts on the wheel. The part of
Death.
Without it, this world would not be, but as well, im here to view the
beauty of
it. Rather than the pain people feel from it."
 
(The Thaumaturgists): You say, "You know, we could talk over here
instead of
loading our messages up?"
 
(The Thaumaturgists): Gregg says, "Oh yeah."
 
Message #2184       Sent by: Gregg
6/13/5:15 "Heh"
 
(The Thaumaturgists): Gregg says, "I'ms used to havin whole
conversations in
messages."
 
Hypnos begins to wield a bronze ritual knife in his left hand.
 
 
Hypnos begins to wield a wooden bowl in his right hand.
 
(The Thaumaturgists): You say, "Dare ya to blow out the candle."
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "As i take this knife within my
hands. I
am about to show another part of this system i have layed before me.
With my
life, soul, earth, and devotion. I leave but one item out. My very
blood."
 
(The Thaumaturgists): Gregg says, "Heh."
 
(The Thaumaturgists): Gregg says, "Ifs I do... think he'll die?"
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "My very blood is my promise. Its
what
binds me, and its my ever dieing oath. With my blood i show my
willingness to
keep on. to never go back on my word. As well to show my promise to the
Lord of
Death, that im here to serve him forever."
 
Hypnos begins to wield a pinewood vial in his right hand.
 
Hypnos slits his wrist and holds it out, filling a pinewood vial with
fresh
blood.
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "Now, as i start to pour my blood
over
this candle. it will show how my faith lies. Should the very flame go
out, it
will be shown i been lieing and i have something in me to tend. Though
should
it stay, my word speaks truth unto you my Lord."

Slowly, Hypnos pours his blood over the candle. As it falls toward the
candle,
there is slience in the room.
** Illusion **
 
Then as it embraces the candle, the flame flickers violently. Yet as
every
amount of blood has fallen. The flame still remains.

(The Thaumaturgists): Gregg says, "He's not actually invokin the power
of
Thoth... how, disappointin."
 
Hypnos kneels onto one knee, demonstrating his humility and respect.
 
Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "My beloved Lord Thoth, may this
come to
you as a symbol of my love onto you. As my actions and words promote my
deepest
devotion to you. May it forever shrine through and show to you, that i
will
never stop following you."
 
Hypnos stands up and stretches his arms out wide.

Hypnos Cypher, Viperas Eruditus says, "That is it. i know it isnt much.
but
again, as i said its how i show my devotion."

You say, "This is just going to be a small ritual and story telling
about the
Birth of My Goddess...Estach is going to be my co-ritualist, any
comments are
welcome, but please wait till the end for everyone's enjoyment. Any
questions
before we start?"


Solarus shakes his head.

Solarus, Strange Attractor says, "Whats a co-ritualist."

You stick out your tongue and say, "Someone helping me with the ritual."

Delphinus Windancer says, "Aye, how long will it be? Not to sound as
though in
a rush, but the clock's against me."

You say, "Not long."

You say, "We begin."

Murmuring sibilant invocations to the Goddess of Destruction, you crouch
down
and firmly press the chalk against the ground. With a smooth motion, you
draw a
small stick of black chalk clockwise, moving as you do so to inscribe a
spacious circle.

You reach out and touch a chalk outline of a black circle.
Flicking open a tinderbox, you gently touch its flame to the chalk
circle. The
ashy black chalk catches aflame slowly, the low flame moving around the
circle
at a measured pace.

You say, "Ever shining Light met all consuming darkness.. Ethian
subsumed by
Abbadon, only to destroy its destroyer in turn."

Thick black smoke billows upwards from a chalk outline of a black
circle. The
smoke is strangely confined to the area within the circle, resulting in
a
swirling black column.

You reach out and touch a chalk outline of a black circle.
With a bit of the black chalk still on your finger, you kneel and
inscribe a
complex sigil within the circle.

Within the smoke drifting from the circle, a large blinding sphere of
light
becomes consumed by a large well of what appears to be nothing. A few
seconds
after the complete engulfment of the star, the dark void shatters and
explodes.
Shimmering dust scatters and begins to fall, small, coloured shapes
vaguely
recognizable as dragon phantoms swirling through the dust.

Estach Mercadia says, "Remnants of a fallen sun, settled amongst us, the
foresaken children scattered to the stars."

The dust begins to collect and coalesce, becoming six perfect spheres
surrounding the group.

You say, "The Crossing, the power of the dead sun manifesting once
again,
cycles running in turn-."

Suddenly the spheres crack and go dim.

Estach Mercadia says, "- Only to once again be broken."

The ritualists clap their hands, the spheres shattering into dust once
again. A
red blur appears and circles about the room, gathering the swirling dust
into a
vortex it creates by its flight, a screech piercing through the air as
the blur
takes shape into a dragon.

You say, "Ethian's child, rekindle the flame and birth destruction!"

The Vortex collapses in on itself. As the image fades away, a melodious
female
laugh can be heard echoing throughout the room.

You exclaim, "Hail the Destoyer, Blessed be Lady Makali!"

Estach Mercadia exclaims, "Hail the Destroyer, Blessed be Lady Makali!"

The flames lick at the last of the black chalk circle remaining upon the
ground, then subside completely.

Augury 1- Snowflake



The end of the glacier.

A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey.
The patches of ice have coalesced, combined into one vast sheet. The
glacier is smooth and mirror-like, reflecting the rays of the sun in a
dazzling array of light, or the moon in a serene and ghostly aura.
Travel along here is difficult, as the glacier is dotted with crevasses.
The slippery ice lends a dangerous aspect to this, making for unsure
footholds near the deep chasms. You find that passage beyond a short
walk is impeded by a giant crack in the glacier that stretches the whole
way from one side of the icy river to the other. An icewall is here,
blocking passage to the north. Portia Darkwind, Huntress of the Wild is
here. She wields a tower shield in her left hand. Prophet of Babel,
Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac is here, sprawled on the floor. He wields a
tower shield in his left hand and ugly white granny panties in his
right.
You see a single exit leading north.

Gregg closes his eyes and rubs his temples, slowlying opening his eyes
and returning his gaze to the bowl.

Deepest Stygian night steals over the land as the symbolic hourglass
empties
and turns, ready to begin a new day.
It is now the 18th of Miraman, 358 years after the fall of the
Selucarian
Empire.

Gregg puts a small wooden bowl on the fire, letting it rest over the low
burning flame.

Gregg reaches his arms around and picks up a close by large chunck of
ice, weighing it carefully in his hands before setting it in the bowl.

The cloud cover clears, revealing the sparkling night sky.

Gregg sits still while gazing into the bowl watching as the ice slowly
begins to melt.

Gregg takes the five candles from his pouch and lights each one in the
small firepit, setting them in a tight circle around the firepit.

The night sky is clear, and the stars twinkle like diamonds.

Gregg takes up the brown candle as the wax slowly begins to seep down
the side, he tilts it over the bowl letting a few drops of wax drip into
the bowl.

Gregg sets down the candle back down being sure to put it in the same
spot, before fixing his gaze on the red candle.

Gregg takes up the red candle and drips it into the bowl. The bowl gives
off an almost sinister dark red hue as the wax drops into it.

Gregg puts back down the red candle, again careful to put it in the same
spot before taking up the blue candle.

Gregg drips the blue candle into the bowl, which causes the hue to
lightens immediately into a pleasant soothing colour.

Gregg puts the blue candle again in the same spot, taking the green
candle and tilts it over the bowl as with the other candles. This time
the pattern in the bowl begin to spin in circles, going clockwise.

With nary a whisper nor a sigh, rosy-fingered dawn creeps into the land,
stealing the soul of the night.

Gregg sets down this blue candle and finally takes the last pink candle.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac watches, fascinated.

Gregg drips five drops from the pink candle, forming the outline of a
circle if you conected the dots.... or would it make a five point star?

Gregg sets the last candle down, careful to set it again in the same
spot as he picked it up from.

The five pink dots of the last candle seem to melt away, as the spinning
wax engulfs it, leaving faint pink lines, which themselves fade away
into the rest of the wax.

Gregg watches as the colours in the wax shift and change, seemingly
random dots of colour appear and disappear in the mixture of wax.

Gregg closes his eyes, giving the appearance that he feels rather than
watches the allure of the wax mixture. Which spins in circles faster and
faster.

Gregg in one swift motion grabs at the bowl, which must be hot from the
fire, and sets it in the behind him. The hissing of steam is given off
as the ice around the bowl melts.

Gregg licks his fingers and uses them to snuff the flame in each of the
candles. Starting with the brown candle, and finishing with the pink
going in the same order he added them to the mixture.

You say, "An that concludes the ritual portion."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Beautiful."

You smile and say, "We still haves to see the final product."

Gregg reaches behind him and takes the bowl.

Flair nods his head emphatically.

You say, "Was there a question ya was thinkin? Ifs so it may of affected
whats we see here."

You say, "'anything' on yer mind wills of affected whats was formed."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "I always have
questions."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "These desert visions
and dreams I've been having are alwyas on my mind these days."

Gregg shows the mixture in the bowl to you. To your surprise the
hardened wax isn't a mass of wax. Its instead at a quick glance a
pentagram, yet the pentacle doesn't look quite like the regular five
point star.

"Ooohhhhhhhhhh," says Flair.

The star in the pentacle after closer inspection seems to reach out from
a center point, with a beautiful pattern of branches on each of the five
points. The colour is a uniform silver.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac looks into the bowl, wondering
what it means.

You say, "A snowflake."

Flair nods his head emphatically.

Flair stands up and stretches his arms out wide.

You say, "Whats it means... I'ms sure we coulds haves a whole discussion
over."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "We'll have to think on
it."

You say, "Ya was thinkin of yer visions in the desert?"

Flair nods his head emphatically.

The bright sun shines down upon you.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "That and Jozlyn's cold
cold heart. Just kidding."

You utter a deep, rumbling laugh at Flair.

You ask, "So ya liked the ritual?"

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Yeah, it was very
nicely done."

You say, "I was just glad nobody cames in durin the middle ofs it."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Me too, but I think
once it got started, the magic kept them away."

You nod your head emphatically.

You say, "As to whats it means... there's no sure way to knows fer
sure."

You say, "Whats it means to ya could be different thans what it means to
me."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Well, maybe future
rituals will help."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "That's true."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "What were you thinking
about?"

You say, "I was thinkin ofs a way to better understand chaos."

"Ooohhhhhhhhhh," says Flair.

You say, "Thats was my question I thoughts to myself."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "That makes sense. No
two snowflakes are alike....very interesting."

You say, "Buts I also asked fer success in future rituals."

Flair nods his head emphatically.

You nod your head at Flair.

The bright sun shines down upon you.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "Like a snowflake, right
now, at this moment, the future holds every single possibility, none of
them alike, an infinite amount of futures lay before us."

You say, "Which mights account fers why a snowflake appeared in the
pentagram."

You nod your head at Flair.

Flair nods his head emphatically.

You say to Flair, "Or hows one could search their whole life an yet
never find another snowflake the same as one they saw..."

Flair nods his head emphatically.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "This is fascinating."

You nod your head emphatically.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "The thing I like about
rituals is that they usually ask more questions than they answer."

You say, "An the snowlands of the tundra cans be a dessert in their own
rite."

You nod your head at Flair.

Flair nods his head emphatically.

You say, "Right too heh."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "In fact, the desert,
the tundra, fire and ice, but really the same thing on two different
poles..."

The roar of a mountain lion echoes off cliffs and through canyons.

You ask, "Mmm, death by fire or by ice?"

Flair nods his head emphatically.

You smile with a wink and say, "Reminds me ofs a poem or somethin."

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "You have to post this!"

Flair grins and nods.

Banishing the light, Lord Twilight conjures Stygian darkness over the
land and the bright moon enters the heavens.

Prophet of Babel, Flair D'Ischai-Saer'rac says, "You're doing good work
up here all alone."

The corners of Flair's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
