Enlighten (Occultism)                         Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            ENLIGHTEN <target>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          4.00 seconds of equilibrium
Resource:          2% karma
Details:
Perhaps the cruelest curse imaginable, you can reveal the occult
mysteries to a non-initiate as you have learned it. Their minds must be
sufficiently open for the revelation to be received. In other words,
they must have six(*) of: claustrophobia, agoraphobia, lovers, dementia,
epilepsy, hallucinations, confusion, stupidity, paranoia, vertigo,
shyness, addiction, recklessness, or masochism.

If such is the case, you may give that target the revelation of what the
nature of the universe is as you see it, which will unfortunately make
their insanities permanent until death.

* This number drops to five if they are suffering from the curse of
whispering madness.
