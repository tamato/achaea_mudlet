Foreward:

The colours that vibrate in tune with the aura can be separated into
seven distinct shades: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and
Violet. The manipulation of these, the Seven Rays, grants tremendous
strength to those who practice the Occult Arts.

This primer delves into the various properties of each individual Ray.
It is of utmost importance that the word individual be noted, as when
combined and invoked simultaneously, the Seven Rays differ in effect and
aspect.

With that understanding, please, read on. The mysteries of the Seven
Rays of Chaos await you.

The Red Ray:

The Red Ray resonates most strongly with the root chakra of an
individual. As such, any meditative invocations will be centered there.
The main aspects associated with the Red Ray, are those of passion and
sex.

In general practice, the Red Ray is used to create heartstones. However,
ritualistically, its use is far broader.

The Red Ray is used to root the body and mind to the Prime Material
plane, to siphon off the bodily afflictions cause by wayward rituals, as
well as to bind extraplanar creatures to this plane.

The grounding properties of this Ray serve two purposes. The first is to
modify the bodies and auras of the extraplanar entities to more closely
integrate with this Plane, thus making their stay longer. Whether they
will it or not. The second is to reassociate the self with the natural
plane, the Prime Material. The latter application is mainly used for
those who have been wandering the extremes of the multiverse and need to
release some of the energy picked up in their travels.

As a note, invoking the Red Ray while off of the Prime Material plane
can help grant you direction by attuning yourself to the Prime. This is
useful if you are in a plane like Limbo, where there is no direction and
all about is grey fog. A word of caution, however. Do not try to invoke
the Red Ray for binding purposes while off of the Prime Material plane.
The Red Ray is too closely connected to the Prime. Should this Ray be

invoked used as a binding energy, the results could be disastrous, both
for the creature and for the invoker.

The Orange Ray:

This Ray is found and invoked within the next chakra, the stomach*. The
Orange Ray is by far the most enigmatic of the Seven Rays. Even the
Chaos Lords themselves respect its power, as I discovered upon
attempting to gain insight from the Dark Savant. Its ritualistic aspect
is that of perserverance.

In practical application, this Ray is used to enlighten someone whose
mind is sufficiently open to the truth. However, the colour summoned is
not quite a pure orange, but seems to be a bit of an amalgamation with
red. The melding of two Rays, as may be evident in this case, takes a
tremendous strength of will and a great deal of karmic understanding.

Unfortunately little is known about this Ray, even amongst the Court.
Perhaps further research will provide the answer to this puzzling
question.

Its invocation in ritual is a dangerous thing. It too, can serve as a
far more powerful binding energy than the Red Ray. However, our control
over this Ray is too unstable to use on a reliable basis. Should
something go awry with the Orange invocation, you will find yourself
bound in body, mind, spirit, or any combination thereof. An assistant
will be required to invoke the Green Ray to nullify the harmful effects
of the Orange.

To aid the reader in research, ponder the following, and see where your
thoughts lead you:

What is it about the Orange Ray that makes it something to be so
respected, and even feared, by the Imperial Court?

Why did the ancients, in all their power and knowledge, not seek to
further their comprehension of this Ray?

Given what little we do know of this Ray, what conclusions can be drawn
of its potential?

The Yellow Ray:

This Ray is found and invoked within the third chakra, that of the solar
plexus.

A very offensive energy, the Yellow Ray relates to the mind. More
specifically, the draining of knowledge, even of self into a repository
- its chakra.

Ritualistically, I believe it can be utilized to strip knowledge from an
individual and grant it to the invoker. Along the lines of an
interrogation, but without the chance for misleading lies.

Amongst my own research into its usage, I have, as of yet, been unable
to successfully siphon information from an individual into myself. I
have been able to wipe clean specific knowledge, but there seems to be
some interference with the transferral.

The Green Ray:

The Green Ray is found and invoked within the heart chakra.

The only Ray with no offensive leanings, the Green Ray is the embodiment
of healing energy. Commonly used to cure pupils of blindness, deafness
and hopefully laziness, it can be used to much greater effect elsewhere.

It has the capacity to heal, through ritual invocation, maladies of
mind, body and spirit. It can even be used to rejuvenate the body, renew
old skin and yes, even to reverse the effects of aging.

This is the gentlest energy an Occultist can invoke, and is the only one
I have managed to fully meld with my aura. A side effect, as some may
have noticed, is that I am constantly wreathed with verdant lightning.
This energy normally remains dormant, visible only as a nimbus around my
hands. However, during times of emotional agitation, the lightning
lashes out at the surroundings in a rather spectacular light show.

Here are some things of interest involving this manifestation of the
Green Ray:

The lightning never strikes anything living, even the plants remain
wholly unharmed.

It only reacts in a seemingly violent way when my emotional state is
heightened.

[File continued via MORE]
The explanations behind these two observations are, I believe, directly
related to the very nature of the Green Ray. It is by nature a healing
energy. As such, harming anything else would go act against its normal
vibratory state. Also, as a healing energy, it involves empathy. Empathy
being based within emotion, during states of heightened emotions, the
Green Ray also becomes more active, more heightened.

As to the idea that the Green Ray is capable of halting and even
reversing the aging process, I need only look in a mirror to check its
veracity. I appear to be no older than my mid-twenties, however as of
this writing, I am sixty years old. I managed to fully meld my aura with
the Green Ray's vibration during my late thirties, so it seems to be a
fairly solid causal relationship.

I offer a bit of caution to those eager to test the powers of the Green
Ray. While it is the easiest of the Rays to integrate, the regenerative
benefits have so far only affected my body. My mind has, and it seems
will continue to, aged. So do not expect to keep your youthful mind
along with your young body.

The Blue Ray:

Located and invoked within the throat chakra, this Ray is representative
of the power of the mind and of perception.

This Ray is most commonly used to grant a heightened awareness of the
world. I also believe that an aspect of this Ray is invoked when one
seeks out the location of another via Occult methods.

The Blue Ray can be used ritualistically to improve our mental status,
expand our minds (much like myrrh) and increase our ability to
communicate. This last aspect, if taken to its full potential, I believe
can grant a semblance of telepathy to the invoker. It is most prudent to
invoke the energies of the Blue Ray before summoning any extraplanar
creature, so as to be sure you are capable of communicating with it.

In regards to influencing mental states, it is very reminiscent of the
Green Ray. It can be used to soothe and calm an unsteady mind, and to
bolster flagging mental reserves (useful for an assistant to invoke
during a long incantation or other strenuous mental activities).

The Indigo Ray:

Representative of the bridging of the gap between body, mind and spirit,
this Ray is found and invoked within the chakra of the third eye.

This is most commonly used to sever the bond between the spirits of
nature and the aura of others. Ritualistically, it serves much the same
purpose, severing and mending the bonds between the facets of being. One
such application is spirit walking (allowing the soul to wander free of
its mortal coil without suffering the anguish of death) as well as
mending wounds to the spirit itself.

Be warned, invoking any of the Rays while discorporate is nigh
impossible. An assistant will be necessary to invoke the Indigo Ray,
probably in conjunction with the Green and Blue Rays, in order to
restore the bond between the facets of being, and to repair any damage
that may have occurred during the experiment.

The Violet Ray:

The representation of transcendent understanding (not to be confused
with any ranks one attains through studying a skill), the Violet Ray is
found and invoked within the Crown chakra.

This Ray is strange in that it resonates in two different wavelengths.
On one hand, it is used or invoked to raise our consciousness to higher
states, allowing glimpses into the Weave itself. On the other hand, it
represents complete control over the aura.

In Occult practices, it is used in the latter aspect in several ways:
removing aural anomalies, distorting our own aura, and siphoning off
aural energies to provide a shield against injury.

As the ultimate Ray, its power is extremely versatile and quite potent.
Ritualistically speaking, using the Violet Ray to craft wards is ideal.
The wards affect anything that has any aural resonance (so undead and
other soulbleed creations will require other methods). The reason the
Violet Ray makes for such strong wards, is that they bar even those in
the spirit realm (not death, but spirit, such as Shamanic or Natural
totems) and can be tuned to allow specific entities entry and exit
without harm to the invoker or to the entity.

The Seven Rays:

So far, the Rays have been spoken of individually. In this, the chants
to invoke the Rays will be revealed, as will the effects of combining
all Seven Rays into one tremendous blast of energy that Occult scholars
name, the Chaos Rays.

Invocations:

Red:    Om Dawwru
Orange: Om Jahih
Yellow: Om Budmi
Green:  Om Qitwavey
Blue:   Om Hilo
Indigo: Om Jojers
Violet: Om Witaze

The meditative repitition of those chants invokes the power of the Ray.

The Rays undergo a change when combined together, and evoke the
following responses upon those struck with their energies:

Red:    Fire damage
Orange: Paralysis
Yellow: Electrical damage
Green:  Healing
Blue:   Cold Damage
Indigo: Stupidity
