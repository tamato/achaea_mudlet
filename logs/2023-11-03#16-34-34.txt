--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He is a mhun. One gloved hand resting easily upon the iron hilt of a black blade at his waist, this
battle veteran displays a devil-may-care grin as he considers the world about him. A weatherproof 
overcoat extends below his knees, its upturned cuffs displaying twin lines of brass buttons. Though 
his bestubbled chin and ruffled mane undermine its striking impression, his uniform displays a clear 
military theme, walking an easy line between regimental finery and rumpled insouciance. The hard 
soles of the warrior's rolled-down canvas boots cast his echoing footsteps through the air, a herald 
of the violence to come. Carved into the flesh of his right cheek is the Mark of the Twin "II". 
Drawn on the other cheek in crude charcoal is the word, "Idiot". A rune shaped like a mighty oak has 
been sketched onto him. A rune resembling an elk has been sketched onto him.

He is wearing:
   a menacing suit of Ashtani full plate, Robes of the Magi, a Sash of Caymus, Boots of Dexterity, a
pair of Logosian Gauntlets, Gloves of Extraction, a mask of lifevision, a Collar of Agatheis, a Belt 
of Aegis, a Runic Gauntlet, a Hood of the Sphinx, and a set of alchemical robes.
Weapon holders:
   a twisted scabbard of steel and bone and an alligator skin quiver.
Containers:
   a bag of sharing and a dragonskin pack.
Jewellery:
   4 earrings of Sinope through his left ear, a silver badger earring through his left ear, and 3
earrings of Sinope through his right ear.
Misc:
   a pair of eagle's wings, chitin greaves, a pernicious pair of Dala'myrr claws, a deck of mystical
cards, a Stygian pendant, Suremekh'neina, an Aldar talisman, a shackle of Garash, a clasp of vocal 
intensity, Vakha's bribe, a living third eye upon his brow, a buckawn's amulet, a set of mithril 
spurs, a cabalist's cowl, an Armband of Celerity, a kaleidoscopic crown, Bracers of Frost, a glacial 
sapphire brooch, a deck of tarot cards, and silver fangs.

the ultimate nonexistence. No past, nor present, nor future. Only cessation.

15.16 Undeath

So you're freshly undead, and you might be thinking to yourself "What should I do?".

Fret not, my rotting friends, for that is why you have this guide.

1) Becoming Undead

The Soulbleed Nexus is said by many foolish living to be a nasty thing, drawing on the deaths of
mortals to forge the undead we know and love! Happen to die in the wrong circumstance and you (the 
player) may find yourself piloting one of the Underworld's Legion.

You are no longer your normal character.

2) Rising in the Legion

Now that you have become a loyal undead you can defend the Underworld's conquest and kill those
pesky living. You will be able to wield Undeath as a skill, but you may not have much access to it.

Much like a normal army, the more living you kill the higher in the ranks you will rise. Should you
be enthralled again, you may find yourself in a body of much sturdier make and much greater power.

15.16 Undeath

      15.15 < Communication                             HISTORY > 16

So you're freshly undead, and you might be thinking to yourself "What should I do?".

Fret not, my rotting friends, for that is why you have this guide.

1) Becoming Undead

The Soulbleed Nexus is said by many foolish living to be a nasty thing, drawing on the deaths of
mortals to forge the undead we know and love! Happen to die in the wrong circumstance and you (the 
player) may find yourself piloting one of the Underworld's Legion.

You are no longer your normal character.

2) Rising in the Legion

Now that you have become a loyal undead you can defend the Underworld's conquest and kill those
pesky living. You will be able to wield Undeath as a skill, but you may not have much access to it.

Much like a normal army, the more living you kill the higher in the ranks you will rise. Should you
be enthralled again, you may find yourself in a body of much sturdier make and much greater power.

[File continued via MORE]

3) Death after Death

Ah, but even the Undead are not immortal. Both your soul and your physical form will crumble when
you die, happen to lose all your vitality (or "lives") and you'll return to the pathetic realm of 
the living. I've heard rumours of some very powerful Undeath skills that will even cost you lives, 
and some methods to restore them should you desire.

4) Supplies

If you are bereft of curatives, use the PRAY TO THE DEMISE command to restock!



In a more serious tone, the plague of Undeath comes with a few rules and restrictions that players
should be aware of as this event unfolds.

* Functionally, the Undead and regular characters are separate. You cannot punish or seek out
retribution on a main character for the actions of an Undead. Undead, don't out yourselves if you 
can avoid it! You'll have so much more fun.

* If you are Undead, you are free to be attacked and slain by any of the living. You can attack
anyone within Underworld conquered territory as well as any Dauntless, Marks, and infamous folks.

* Transferring items between an Undead and a living character is not allowed. You should not be able
to do this anyway, but if you find some way around it please file a BUG and restrain from doing it. 
Abuse will lead to administrative punishment.

* You will not be able to access your former self while you are an Undead so be aware that if you QQ
you will still be Undead when you return.
