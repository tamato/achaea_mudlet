Amidst several large tombstones.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. This area of the graveyard is apparently reserved for
those who were more fortunate in life. The grave markers, in most cases, are much larger and more 
ornate then the majority found elsewhere. There are even a few smaller, fenced areas where several 
families have been buried over the generations. A light mist slowly drifts through the stones, as 
though searching for something unseen. Bursting out of the ground here is an enormous ankheg statue. 
Servitor Pruxi is here. Servitor Pruxi is here.
You see exits leading northeast, east, and southwest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            INSTILL <target> WITH <affliction>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          2.50 seconds of equilibrium
Resource:          50 mana
Details:
This ability will allow you to instill your victim's aura with various
afflictions. You may select from: asthma, clumsiness, healthleech,
sensitivity, slickness, paralysis, or darkshade.

This process inflicts a minorly taxing influence upon the subject(*),
though the influence is more significant if you are in possession of a
truename derived by the power of the Imperator(**).

* Does some small amount of health and mana damage.
** From the Glaaki ability in domination.

Details:
Through extensive study of the Unnamables, the Occultists of Ashtan have
determined how to mutate the bodies of others in a more controlled
manner than previously believed possible(*). This greater working builds
upon the lesser forms of warping, though requires a far greater degree
of finesse. However, it comes with the unique benefit that lesser
occultic workings(**) may be introduced into the process.

* Does limb damage and a minor amount of health damage. The limb damage
is increased against a limb that is already broken to requiring a
mending salve.
** Lesser works which can be combined are: ague, shrivel, and regress.

The skilled Occultism practitioner will learn to devolve their enemies
to an earlier state of being. However, such mastery is far beyond the
grasp of the student, and so simple exercises should be practiced in
preparation for such higher techniques. Known symptoms in a subject
involve joint failure(*) and organ malfunction, though to date both have
proved temporary and ultimately harmless long term.

* This ability will prone your target.

Marduk (Domination)                           Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            ORDER SOULMASTER POSSESS <target>
                   ORDER <target> <command>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          3.00 seconds of equilibrium
Details:
Marduk will send to you a soulmaster entity. This entity may be ordered
to POSSESS an adventurer. When it does, it will take a few seconds to
gain control of the victim's mind. Once it has done this, you may ORDER
<target> <command>. Doing this is quite difficult for the soulmaster
though, so you will be restricted to doing it once every few seconds.

Firmly-packed of winter's ephemera, this frosty snowball is a flawless sphere unblemished by dirt or

from the hoary powder crumbling off the wintery whole.
It weighs 6 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Cthul.

Report #170
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by: Anonymous      Status      : Approved                 Priority : -2
Skill       : Oppression     Ability     : Deathaura
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Deathaura is a huge swing in momentum for 2h/dwc. It is a consistently 11% health tick on a class
that can already give healthleech, and the damage from deathaura is also increased by sensitivity. 
It makes 2h infernal miles above the other specs. The damage from deathaura can put you in range for 
quash/arc from either dwb or 2h in a very short period of time. It makes fighting the two specs 
extremely uncompetitive.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove deathaura from oppression - it's not needed
Solution #2:
decrease the damage from deathaura - no reason to constantly be in the danger zone for health vs
prep classes.
Solution #3:
repurpose deathaura to be a 5% resist all.

(Classleads): The decision for classlead #170 (Oppression-deathaura) is:
Oppression deathaura is 10% magical damage every 10 seconds  66% of the time, so lets say it on
average will hit for 20% every 30 seconds pre resists/artefact mods (the variation is not 
significant, see your 11% figure in the classlead). Anathema presence is 9% psychic damage every 5 
seconds consistent gated behind manaleech (and functionally asthma). Thus when manaleech is present 
pre resists this would do around 54% over the course of the same time. Obviously this is not 
realistic given this is a late game finisher, but it is illustrative for our purposes here. Excision 
fervour deals 150 + (1-150) + 3% of hp, so lets just call it a conservative 3.5% every 10 seconds 
consistent gated behind tenderskin (and functionally pyre). Therefore fervour does a terrifying 10% 
fire damage pre resists (yikes) over the course of 30 seconds (it does have an easier conditional 
than presence, however). So in summary, yes infernal has a better frontloaded damage output, but 
Unnamable absolutely crushes it late game. I'll be buffing fervour to make it not dire, fairly sure 
these values are balanced around a five second tick rate rather than ten..

4.6.1 Queueing

        4.6 < EQUILIBRIUM AND BALANCE                    TITLES > 4.7

Adventurers may have differing levels of latency (or lag), which has the
potential to affect the outcome of a battle. To combat this, Achaea has a
server-side queueing system that will automatically attempt to run a command
when you recover balance.


Automatic Queueing
------------------
When using automatic queueing, there are two types of queues, one for physical balance and one for
mental equilibrium. Items are added to this queue when they're attempted while off their respected 
balance. For example: You're hunting rats with your sword, and JAB RAT to attack it. If you 
attempted to JAB RAT while still off balance from the first attack, it'll be added to the queue and 
will run automatically when you regain balance next.

Queue-related commands:

CONFIG USEQUEUEING <ON|OFF>             - Enable or disable the queueing
                                          functionality.
CONFIG SHOWQUEUEALERTS <ON|OFF>         - Enable or disable the system messages
                                          regarding queueing.


Manual Queueing
---------------
Alternatively, you may manually insert items into your queue. Manually inserted items may use any
combination of the queue types available below.

Queue-related commands:

CLEARQUEUE <queue>                      - Clear one of your queues.
CLEARQUEUE ALL                          - Clear everything out of your queues.

                                          queues.
QUEUE ADDCLEAR <queue> <command>
                                        - Clear the specified queue and add an

                                        - Add an item to a specific point in one
                                          of your queues.
QUEUE PREPEND <queue> <command>
                                        - Add an item to the start of one of

QUEUE CLEAR <queue>
                                        - Same as CLEARQUEUE


Queue Limits and Specifics
--------------------------
Queued commands are limited to a maximum of ten across ALL QUEUE TYPES. This limit is not per-queue.
INSERTing or PREPENDing queue commands past your queue limit will remove the last queued command 
across all queues. ADDCLEAR will remove queued commands of the specified queue type, and if there is 
still not space in the queue, the command will fail. ADDCLEARFULL will remove all queued commands 
and then insert the new command at the beginning of your queue.
