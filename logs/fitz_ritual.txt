Fitz says in Ashtani with a sibilant, Ashtani accent, "I have chosen this location for simple
reasons, it stands between many focal points of Chaotic power and history. To the northwest, the bog 
and the Caverns. To the north, our home the seat. Due south, the Great Rock, where our Lord was 
trapped, and to the southeast sits the crater where the Living Spire was, destroyed when He 
reappeared."


Gripping a sinuous bone knife in faes right hand, Fitz makes an incision along faes forearm,
gathering blood on the blade.

With steady steps he walks a slow circle about the forest floor with the blade to create a boundary.
The blood arcs from the blade, circumscribing a circle.

a tapestry of fine ridges and tiny, interlocking segments. Each of her six legs, adorned with 
minuscule bristles and spiked tibial teeth, moves with a grace that belies her sturdy appearance. 
Filament-like antennae sway gently in the air, attuning to unseen vibrations. Her burnished shell is 
etched in fractal patterns, their passage carving narrow furrows in the chitin. A trio of small 
horns jut upward from the top of her wide, small head, curling back towards her bulbous midsection. 
Thick chitinous armour sheathes her wings, while ever-moving mandibles exude soft chitters and 
clicks.
