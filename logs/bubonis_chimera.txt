The spectator enclosure. (indoors)
Crackling ozone heralds warp-touched mirage, their coming the advent of change. This is a large semi
-covered stone enclosure, which has been constructed on a small hill, overlooking the western 
quarter of what were once the Royal Gardens of Ashtan. Maintained after the fall of the Crown, they 
contain the massive tomb of Glanos, the founder of Ashtan, visible to the north. The Ashtan arena 
itself has been built upon this ancient part of history. The tomb rests directly in the centre of 
the main grounds with a large, shadowy forest to the west and a tranquil garden to the east. The 
main gate to the crypt is on the south face and to the far north you can make out thousands of dark 
gravestones. Bounding it all is an intact section of the massive wall that surrounds the Royal 
Compound. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 5 Ashtani corsairs here. 
Servitor Pruxi is here. Fae wields a cavalry shield in faes left hand.
