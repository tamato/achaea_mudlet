 a statue of Palpatar, Glutton of Glaaki

Heaping piles of rotten flesh and meat adorn the pedestal occupied by the grotesque image of Lord Palpatar. The Corpulent One rests upon his side in golden glory, an accurate monument to excess and gluttony. The pudgy palm of the figure is ever outstretched, demanding more to feed the oversized worms crawling about the statue. Chained at the foot of the massive iron form, a prisoner of war kneels next to the swollen Chaos Lord, holding a plate of maggot-infested offerings for consumption.
