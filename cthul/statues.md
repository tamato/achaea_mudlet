Buul, the Chaos Chirurgeon, roomid 619
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The form of the mad Chirurgeon is bent fully over here like a rat, his razor sharp claws caught in
the midst of pulling apart the ribcage of an unwilling victim. The rusted iron features of the 
unfortunate soul is twisted beyond comprehension, reflecting the madness that has consumed him. 
Flanking the Chaos Lord is the hulking form of a chimera; the amalgamated creature holds a pristine 
heart in its mouth, freshly harvested to join a mountain of organs forming a truly grotesque font in 
honour of this chaotic scientist.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.



Rixil, the Spectre
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cunningly created from a mixture of flawless and blackened iron, thinly hammered metal is moulded
into the vague silhouette of this shadowed spectre. Streaks of grey and black fight for supremacy 
from the base to the apex of the statue, resulting in a smoky appearance. Random, swirl-shaped 
perforations riddle Rixil's form in a haphazard pattern, the pinpoints of light passing through it 
flickering and warping occasionally.

Arctar, the Defender
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three large shields dig deep into the ground and splay out in opposing directions, tilted like
buttresses to hold a massive, shifting orb aloft. This intimidating contraption is wrought of 
numerous swords, lashes, and chains melted together and suspended in a neverending dance of 
controlled destruction. The clanking and gnashing of weapons echoes from the bombastic, dark iron 
monument to the Defender, thrumming deep into the surroundings.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.
**A statue of Arctar, the Defender holds a tenuous link to the Plane of Chaos.**


Scrag
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Red agate serves as the pedestal upon which rises a rusted iron statue of a dwarf, encircled by a
throng of meticulously carved bloodleeches. A swivelling pair of mad, bulging eyes are set upon the 
features of the maniacal Chaos Lord, complete with a wide grin, laugh lines, and wrinkles. Rich in 
texture and fine detail, Scrag does not merely stand amongst his beloved bloodleeches; instead, he 
is engulfed by their slick, grotesque bodies, becoming one with them as they are with him.


Eerion, the demon Jester.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dressed in a suit of neatly stamped diamonds, a macabre jester dominates the iron stage upon which
he is cast. Paralysed mid-swing, tiny bells hang from his floppy, forked hat, the would-be tones of 
their rings forever silenced. Areas of extremely pale red and gold seep from his outfit, as if ages 
of constant prancing wore away the purity of the materials from which they were forged. An 
exaggerated grin distorts his crevassed face, pushing his bulbous cheeks high and wide. Heavily 
furrowed brows slice downward toward his sharply angled nose, narrowing his eyes into red-stained 
slits. His fervid stare and sinister grin mock his gleeful prancing, suggesting he is wrought with 
lunacy.
**Holds a tenous link with the ChaosPlane**

Lord Palpatar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heaping piles of rotten flesh and meat adorn the pedestal occupied by the grotesque image of Lord
Palpatar. The Corpulent One rests upon his side in golden glory, an accurate monument to excess and 
gluttony. The pudgy palm of the figure is ever outstretched, demanding more to feed the oversized 
worms crawling about the statue. Chained at the foot of the massive iron form, a prisoner of war 
kneels next to the swollen Chaos Lord, holding a plate of maggot-infested offerings for consumption.

Danaeus, the Dark Savant
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrought from dark iron, a tall and narrow figure stands atop a gleaming obsidian base that mirrors
the towering statue as a shadow would. Wreathed in a tattered black cloak, the metallic visage of 
Danaeus offers scant clues about his appearance, preserving the aura of mystery surrounding him. A 
deep hood casts his head into shadows and only the glimmer of two blood rubies can be discerned, 
mimicking the red glow of the Chaos Lord's true sight. Emerging from two draping sleeves, skeletal 
hands of a pristine ivory hue reach upwards, with one securing the hood while the other holds a 
large tome at eye level. Simple in design, its cover bears a single symbol: an upward-facing 
triangle surrounded by a spiral.


Skyrax, the Skscourge
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dusky slate forms the lithe, jagged features of this statue of Lord Skyrax. The flesh of the Chaos
Lord is drawn tightly together, his gaunt appearance emphasised by a set of dull, shale eyes that 
stare blankly ahead. One hand is raised to the sky, the fingers slightly curved in a claw-like 
fashion. Shining robes of silver drape across the entity's slender iron frame and hangs loose at the 
shoulders and waist.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.
**A statue of Skyrax, the Skyscourge holds a tenuous link to the Plane of Chaos.**



Nin'Kharsag, the Slime Mas
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Green rust creeps along the surface of a moulded iron geyser that spouts high above its heavy stone
base. The smooth pillar is topped with a frothy spray, caught at the peak of its bubbling, cyclic 
eruptions. A screaming face presses fervently outward from one side of the funnel, its contorted 
features stretching the surface thin but unable to break free. Numerous circular bumps protrude from 
the metallic framework elsewhere, hinting to the eerie births of other tormented faces. A protective 
coating of beeswax gives the statue the appearance of a glistening, wet finish and preserves the 
beautiful green colour.

Thin metal strips resembling sinew struggle to secure chunks of iron-clad flesh forming the decaying
form of this freakish statue. Sliding free of the constraints of its vessel, a partially exposed 
spine protrudes from the figure's back, the thick vertebrae disproportionate to the shrunken head it 
supports. Flesh melts from Cadmus' skull who flashes a bony grin to his surroundings, his lidless 
eyes never looking away from his unseen audience. Countless flies infest the Chaos Lord, their 
frail, flitting bodies joining the thick, rancid pools of dubious substance leaking from the statue 
and flooding the pedestal.


Tattered, paper-thin robes drape over this statue of Istria, his true features a mystery beneath his
billowing garments. Rendered in dark iron, the aged man is a smoky presence rising from a pedestal 
covered with esoteric glyphs and runes of power. Deep wrinkles plague a visible hand of the Chaos 
Lord, his gnarled fingers emerging from one sleeve to clutch at his cowl. A quiet aura of power 
surrounds this monument.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.

Blackened iron forms the inhuman statue of Lord Xenophage. Small in stature, he surrounds himself
with chests full of gemstones so intricately carved that no jewel is alike. Swirling upwards from a 
smooth obsidian base, the elemental powers are further depicted in visible forms: serpentine trails 
of water spiral around the Keeper of the Chaos Gate, accented by the voracious surge of frozen 
flames that lick at the hem of his windswept robes. A look of utter disdain is apparent in the 
statue's features as he stares down at his unseen audience.



Appearing human, Piridon exemplifies the race with an indisputable set of attractive features. From
the gleam of his golden eyes that cast a condescending gaze to the curl that sets his full lips into 
an arrogant smirk, his facial qualities are bisymmetrical perfection. The noble nose, pronounced 
cheekbones, and angular silhouette of his jawline might be mistaken for artistic emphasis, but the 
Shapechanger requires no exaggeration to capture his flawlessness. His posture is befitting of a 
Lord, as he rests one hand on a large, circular mirror. Curiously, etched upon its surface is a 
featureless mask bearing the outline of two ovoid eyes. His other hand rests on his hip in a gesture 
that implies both his arrogance and impatience. Well-toned muscles can be inferred by his fitted 
shirt and formal trousers, each etched with thin triangular patterns around the collar and 
waistband. A cloak lined with gold cascades from the broad shoulders of the Chaos Lord and billows 
out in dramatic flare, dramatically accentuating his aura of power.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.

Unbridled and unmuzzled in its polished glory, this effigy of the Keeper of Hounds looks as if it
would tear through any foe. Vicious fangs snarl from the open maw of the latite bust, the stony grey 
material leading up in faux tufts of flawlessly carved fur from the smooth, exposed alabaster flesh 
of the chest. The lower portion of the statue maintains the same pale gloss, chiseled into the 
perfect torso of a male human gripping a long, sinuous whip in his hand.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.

Hecate, Mother of the Crones, room id 470
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A reinforced iron disc serves as the support for this immense statue, forged into the shape of a
towering woman. Deeply creased skin and intelligent eyes grant her an air of wisdom, despite the 
ominous nature of her wide, toothless smile. Gore-like splatters and clumps of hair adhere to a 
large kettle positioned over a roaring fire before the Chaos Lady. Stooped within a tent-like dress, 
the old crone stands next to her misty cauldron and reaches into a fly-covered jar. Grinning broadly 
with a knowing look, her large, pudgy hand carefully conceals the contents, the ingredients cooking 
in the blackened pot remaining a mystery yet.
It weighs about 1000 pounds.
