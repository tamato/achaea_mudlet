Great Rock - touch base of statue

Enfrin, the woodcutter of Thera tells you, "Through it all though Thera's still 
here, always was and always will be... say, if you're interested in more 
history, you should take a gander at the top of the Great Rock sometime. There's
a statue there... well, there usta be. Touch the base where the statue was, I 
promise you that you will see something interesting. 

Oh! And if you head down 
the old road that passes the Rock, towards the Pachacacha as if you were heading
to Cyrene, you might run into an old fisherman on the bridge there with a story 
for you. Ask him about Cyrene's history."


From Season
Seasone the Industrious tells you, "Well now, you sure seemed to enjoy hearing 
about Achaean history. If you want to hear more, there's an old gypsy woman who 
can be found north off the Prelatorian highway, where the highway goes through 
the grasslands, before Green Lake. Why don't you ask her about history?"

A gypsy woman tells you, "Well, that's the end of my story, though there's a 
whole lot more it'd take me years to get into. If you're still in the mood for 
hearing stories, why don't you look up the barkeep at the Seabreeze Tavern in 
Tasur'ke? He'll pour you a mean drink and tell you a tale."

Edric, the barkeep tells you, "You look like you could use a rest. Why don't you
head to the Garden of Whispers here in Tasur'ke, off the eastern end of Anemone 
Way? There are many statues of the Gods there, and I always feel quite refreshed
after I've spent some time contemplating them."

Edric, the barkeep tells you, "There's a little prayer of mine... "Almighty 
Gods, through Your grace may we be blessed." Try whispering that there, you 
might find yourself feeling better."
