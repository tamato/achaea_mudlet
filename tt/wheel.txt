When mysterious forces attempted to gain influence over the Occultists
of Ashtan in the 899th year after the fall of the Seleucarian Empire, a
group of ritualists did the unthinkable and irrevocably damaged the
symbolic nature of their Hierophant. Though it no longer holds any power
in the hands of Occultists, out of their machinations was born a new
card entirely: the first example of a nontransient ruinated image, that
of the Heretic.

When a victim falls under the Heretic's sway, the Occultist may command
them to witness an image: and so long as they are not blind, they will
be unable to avoid gazing upon that which is brought forth.

There are six body parts for the purposes of damage and combat in Achaea:
Head
Torso/Body
Left Arm
Right Arm
Left Leg
Right Leg

Each of these body parts is able to take individual damage, and generally
attacks will tell you which body part they are attacking, if any. If no body
part is shown in an attack, then you are just taking general damage.

Attacks vs. body parts do both general damage against your health, and damage
vs. that body part. However, generally speaking, the damage to your health
done by an attack vs. a body part will be less than if it wasn't targetted to
a body part.

Now, each body part can be at one of three states:

State 0 means that your bodypart is either fully healed, or has taken only
minor damage.

State 1 means that your bodypart has sustained some damage but is still
functional.

State 2 means that your bodypart has been seriously mutilated.


Below is a chart listing the effects of being at State 1 and State 2.

Bodypart        State 1              State 2
--------        -------              -------

Some have been confused in the past by the difference between State 1 and
State 2 damage on a limb, and a limb being broken. It should be emphasized
that they are _not_ the same thing. To better understand how this works,
imagine that when a limb has been damaged, as opposed to broken, the ability
of that limb to heal has been affected, so a simple mending salve will not
heal it without first applying a restoration salve.

In order to deal out body part damage, which is possible with weapons and with
some abilities, you must first obtain the TARGETTING ability in the Weaponry
skill.

Furthermore, if you have the PARRYING ability in Weaponry, you will, if you
have a weapon capable of parrying wielded (Probe it to find out), be able to
parry attacks to a body part, thus taking no damage.

There are six body parts for the purposes of damage and combat in Achaea:
Head
Torso/Body
Left Arm
Right Arm
Left Leg
Right Leg

Each of these body parts is able to take individual damage, and generally
attacks will tell you which body part they are attacking, if any. If no body
part is shown in an attack, then you are just taking general damage.

Attacks vs. body parts do both general damage against your health, and damage
vs. that body part. However, generally speaking, the damage to your health
done by an attack vs. a body part will be less than if it wasn't targetted to
a body part.

Now, each body part can be at one of three states:

State 0 means that your bodypart is either fully healed, or has taken only
minor damage.

State 1 means that your bodypart has sustained some damage but is still
functional.

State 2 means that your bodypart has been seriously mutilated.


Below is a chart listing the effects of being at State 1 and State 2.

Bodypart        State 1              State 2
--------        -------              -------

Some have been confused in the past by the difference between State 1 and
State 2 damage on a limb, and a limb being broken. It should be emphasized
that they are _not_ the same thing. To better understand how this works,
imagine that when a limb has been damaged, as opposed to broken, the ability
of that limb to heal has been affected, so a simple mending salve will not
heal it without first applying a restoration salve.

In order to deal out body part damage, which is possible with weapons and with
some abilities, you must first obtain the TARGETTING ability in the Weaponry
skill.

Furthermore, if you have the PARRYING ability in Weaponry, you will, if you
have a weapon capable of parrying wielded (Probe it to find out), be able to
parry attacks to a body part, thus taking no damage.

(See also: HELP WEAPONRY, HELP THROWING)

Weapons in Achaea may be crucially important or not-so-important, depending on
your class. For instance, those of the monk class fight primarily with their
hands and the power of their minds, and a weapon in their hands only inhibits
the power of their martial arts skills. A Paladin, on the other hand, depends
on his trusty longswords, and to be without them is to be rendered
significantly less powerful. Having said this, all classes may benefit from
occasional use of a weapon. What follows is a discussion of weapons in Achaea,
and how they work.

Bows and archery are specifically omitted here, though they are also a strong
part of combat in Achaea. Both the Chivalry and Subterfuge skills include
abilities related to Archery (HELP CHIVALRY, HELP SUBTERFUGE).


Using Weapons
-------------
Using a weapon in a basic fashion is easy. Simply PROBE the weapon to get a
list of commands that may be used with it, wield it, and then use one of the
weapon's commands. For instance, if it is a sword, JAB <whatever> will work.

In order to wield a weapon, simply type WIELD <weapon>. If you want to wield it
in a specific hand, do WIELD RIGHT/LEFT <weapon>. UNWIELD <weapon> will unwield
it.


Weapon Statistics
-----------------
All non-missile weapons in Achaea possess three common factors that distinguish
how well they work in combat. These are DAMAGE, SPEED, and TO-HIT. Bows are
covered in the individual class-specific ability help scrolls.

The higher the damage number, the more damage you will do. The higher the speed
number, the faster you will be at using the weapon and the higher the to-hit
number, the more easily you will hit your opponents.

You may discover the statistics of a weapon once you have gained the
WEAPONPROBE ability in Weaponry. This ability is fairly low in the skill, so if
you intend to use weapons, it may be worth getting this ability as soon as
possible.

Now, these are not the only factors that affect how effective you are with a
weapon. The other factors are covered in the HELP WEAPONRY scroll.


Weapon Types
------------
Below is a list of some of Achaea's non-missile / non-archery weapons.
One-handed weapons (which may be used with a shield) are indicated with (1h).
Two-handed weapons are marked (2h). All do cutting physical damage
unless otherwise specified:

Longsword    : The standard sword. (1h)
Broadsword   : Cousin to the longsword. (1h)
Shortsword   : A smaller, quicker version of the large swords. (1h)
Scimitar     : A curving sword favoured by those in the east. (1h)
