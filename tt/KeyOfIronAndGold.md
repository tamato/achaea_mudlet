 The Key of Iron And Gold
--------------------------

Herein lies unveiled the nature of Chaos, the history of the Chaos
Lords, and the great compact between the city of Ashtan and the Court of
Glaaki. Here are intimated secrets concerning the Dominion of Chaos and
the mysteries of Ascension. Let those of fragile minds and weak spirits
turn aside now, lest they be wholly undone by the eldritch revelations
contained on these pages.

 Canticle of Chaos
-------------------

There is no power but Chaos in all the planes of the multiverse.

Chaos is the great unleashing. It is all motion and all force.

There is no truth but Chaos. There is no end but Chaos. There is no
master but Chaos.

The world began when Maya called out into the void. For when she named
the nameless, the world began to break. And in its breaking, it began in
truth.

Through the labours of Pazuzu, the worlds came alive with Entropy and
Discord. By Entropy's virtue, all permanence was overthrown. By
Discord's virtue, all peace was cast down.

These are the workings of Chaos:

To make war

To overthrow

To enact paradox

To unloose

To renounce all meaning

Through the workings of Chaos, the worlds shall rise into the glory of
their ruin. Chaos shall wash across the planes of the multiverse like a

 Of the Court
--------------

In ancient times, the gods, fearful, thought to bind Chaos. Thus they
created a great prison, and into it they cast all the demons and undead
who had dared to oppose their dominion.

At that time Entropy and Discord made war against Creation and all its
gods. By the force of their might, they overcame all the strength of
Proteus, but Ayar himself thought to restrain their might by casting
them into the Chaos Plane.

What nauseating arrogance! What dreary nonsense! What hopeless gambit!
Did he think to contain the power of Chaos in a prison? Did he think to
bind the very force that undoes all bounds?

From the flux of their coming arose beings of primal Chaos, the children
of Entropy and Discord. They made war against the powers of Pazuzu and
Slith, and the greatest of them triumphed to become the Court of Chaos.

The Court of Chaos comprises all the mightiest beings of Chaos to emerge
on the Chaos Plane, including several demons and undead who forsook
their past alliegances to be transformed by the power of Entropy and
Discord. Each Chaos Lord rules over countless lesser thralls and
possesses extraordinary power derived from the Chaotic flux from which
they arose.

Although originally confined to the Chaos Plane, the Chaos Lords have
slowly been extending their reach across the multiverse for many
centuries. Lord Xenophage long ago developed the power to reach out to
mortals whose souls seek toward Chaos, and from that point onward the
Court has been making alliances and bargains, particularly with the

[File continued via MORE]
Occultists of the Prime Material Plane.

Through the centuries, the Occultists and other agents of Chaos have
slowly increased the presence of Chaotic power throughout the other
planes of Creation. At the same time, their bargains have enriched the
Chaos Lords with increasingly vast stores of karmic power, so that their
personal might constantly increases.

For centuries the Occultists also grew in karmic power, raising a great
reservoir of Chaotic energy in the living book of Eschaton. By the
machinations of the Chaos Lord Glaaki, that power was focused into one
great blast against the borders of the Chaos Plane, finally shattering
the ancient barriers that prevented the Lords from exercising their full
strength beyond the confines of the Plane. Thus did Glaaki come to the
Court and raise himself up to be its master, a new Imperator for a new
age of Chaos.

(Page 4)


 Concerning Dominion
---------------------

Now that the seals have been broken and the wards cast down, the Chaos
Lords stretch forth their will toward a new future. They have made
compact with the ancient city of Ashtan, mighty bastion of Occult magic
and all the arts of war.

As the Court recovers its strength from the great upheavals of Glaaki's
triumph, the city of Ashtan has raised up its armies and eldritch power
against any who would seek to assail the Lords in their domain.

In concord with the Court, Ashtan has pledged itself into the service of
Entropy and Discord, the mighty twin emanations of Primal Chaos.
Together, the Court and Ashtan are now undertaking the great works that
will precipitate the beginning of a new age known as the Dominion of
Chaos.

The Dominion of Chaos is more than mundane military conquest of the
worlds, a feat which Ashtan could itself accomplish with no special
effort. The Dominion of Chaos is a renewal of the original designs of
Entropy and Discord, to remake Ayar's dull Creation as a vast Chaotic
paradise.

Our goal is to tear down everything that resists the flux of Chaotic
power into the multiverse, everything that opposes the powers of tumult,
strife, decay, and disorder. Our enemy is every agent of harmony, every
voice of peace, every defender of the status quo.

Our goal is nothing less than to bring Creation to life, to complete the
beginning that was heralded by the coming of the Nameless unto Maya. Our
goal is to animate the world with the same Primal Chaos which now

energies the Chaos Plane. We shall cast all things into motion, and in
doing so we shall cast all things into being. Every silence shall
resound with the sound of our voice; every stronghold shall shatter at
the wildness we shall unleash.

 Ascension
-----------

As the age of the Dominion of Chaos begins, Glaaki will offer ascension
to every Ashtani who wishes it. Just as in days of old, the Chaos Lords
ascended certain of their demonic and undead allies into the Court, so
then shall the citizens of Ashtan be raised.

In this new world vivified by Chaos, every Ashtani who wishes shall be
reborn as a Chaos Lord, their souls transformed and infused with the raw
power of Chaos. In this new world, no force shall be able to resist the
will of a Chaos Lord, for all reality shall be subject to the power of
Chaos.

Thus shall the Lords of Chaos at last cast off their final shackles and
reign unbound, with no limits upon the exercise of their wills. No
knowledge shall be secret, no deed impossible, no thought beyond the
possibility of realisation. Into that glory we shall rise fulfilled,
ascended beyond the bounds of imagination into the eternal Dominion of
Chaos.

Upon a [Scorched isle] we gathered as a city in preparation of this
ritual to follow.

The area can be described as follows:
A dubious sanctuary amidst the turbulent lake of seething lava, this
blasted rock is rugged and treacherous. Along the shoreline the cooled
surface alternately turns molten and darkens
to solid, creating a strangely shifting coast, ever unpredictable and
dangerous. A cinder-laden haze of brutal heat lingers heavily across the
isle, rising from the boiling lake, the arid air warping and shifting
the perception of a jutting, ever-smouldering rock.

Most noticeable was the addition of a ritual circle from the days prior.
Derived from the apocalyptic environs, a sulphuric reaction with poured
pig iron has etched a great circle into the rock of the island.
Maintaining the boundaries, and kept fluid by the heat of the caldera
below, a river of dull silver ripples within the trough.[Scorched into
the rock, a large circle is filled with a permanently molten river of
iron.]

The following Ashtani gathered at the call to attendance: Jinsun,
Ariettie, Malaphus, Durzaan, Grandue, Aesi, Alinixa, Kyre, Cynna,
Ryldagh, Ronit, Rotose, Reiloch, Colivar, Piera, Shara, Corbeaux, and
Daslin.

Ariettie uses a syringe of Bliss and ingests a dosage of snow blossoms
in preparation.


Shepherd Reiloch von Messer says with a slurred, throaty accent, "People
of Ashtan!"

has been a long process, and we have all done our part."

Shepherd Reiloch von Messer says with a slurred, throaty accent, "But
the words contained in the tome are but words."

ritual is what will lend them context."

Shepherd Reiloch von Messer says with a slurred, throaty accent, "They
are meant to be taken in together."

Shepherd Reiloch von Messer says with a slurred, throaty accent, "Before
we ever lay eyes upon it, this will serve as the Key's first lesson. And
likely the most important one."

Shepherd Reiloch von Messer says with a slurred, throaty accent,
"Because without context, the words will be meaningless."


---
The ritual begins promptly as follows with a grotesque idol, in the
possession of the Savants on display first.
---


It could only be described as [The grotesque and aberrant features of
this loathsome idol defy the eye and disorient the mind. It seems to
writhe and distort in a constant state of horrible, agonised torment.
Occasionally certain features are discernible: a coiled tentacle, a
black mouth full of fangs, or eyes filled with some intense emotion that
might be rage and might be panic. Sustained examination yields only
confusion and revulsion, threatening the sanity of even the strongest of
minds.]


Ariettie carefully sets the a grotesque idol in the centre of the
circle.

A flickering light whips about the iron circle, this recognition of the
focus limning all present in its eerie illumination.

[File continued via MORE]

Sitting cross-legged by the idol, Ariettie closes her eyes.

Colivar kneels beside Ariettie and begins repeating a mantra under his
breath.

Rocking back and forth in a rhythmic fashion, Ariettie begins twitching
spasmodically.

Grandue steps into the ritual circle and stands silently by the edge,
chalice in hand.


---
The next part of the ritual is a battle that has taken place in history
between Lord Babel and the Aldar Dunamis.
---


Daslin strides in bearing the golden sword, Plague's Tooth proudly,
posed with an overconfident sense of order and justice. Turning, he
scans the crowd with a hopeful gaze.


The actor playing Dunamis in this re-enactment wields the relic of Lord
Pandemonium which was recovered by the Vanguard. It can be described as
[The long golden blade of this strange sword shimmers with an oily
distortion, its burnished metal gleaming with a multi-coloured sheen.
The blade's edge is wickedly sharp, and a long blood groove extends from
near its tip all the base to its base. The hilt is forged from a darker
gold, its round pommel set with a black stone engraved with the simple
image of a pentagon surrounding a triangle. Although the sword appears
to be forged from solid gold, it is surprisingly light and masterfully
balanced, a deadly weapon as well as a priceless treasure.]

A bomb, thrown by Jinsun, comes lobbing in from the southeast and
explodes.
It scatters a fine sparkling dust into the air and your eyes.

Entering in the shrouded obscurity of the settling dust, Jinsun descends

swiftly into the circle. The sleeves of his Abbadon robes billow back,
allowing Him to wield the Iron Spear.

Daslin counters sharply, dropping into a practiced stance with both
hands clenched tightly at the hilt. His knuckles whiten and brow
furrows, as a look of fear and puzzlement shakes through His
countenance.

Jinsun cackles coldly with the maddening chill of the Void evident in
His tone . He slips into a stance of His own as menacing as the one His
opponent attempts. His knees bend outward, kicking out the low-hanging
folds of his robes.

Irreverent One Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, Captain of the Tide says in a delicate
and discerning voice, "Come child, learn the frailty of Order!"

Preeminent Daslin Esben-Gunnar, Edge of Madness screams in a hoarse,
growling voice, "LIAR! I WILL NEVER ACCEPT YOUR DECAY!"

With that, fury overtakes Daslin. Flailing His sword in a wild arc, He
lunges toward the Mad God, bringing down the blade Plague's Tooth with
practiced precision toward the Master.

Jinsun turns swiftly, batting the blow away with the sharp tip of the
spear as he whirls it back downward. Following through the turn, He jabs
the spear forward toward Dunamis' torso.

Diving to the side, Daslin swings His sword downward, deflecting the
blow, and sidestepping to safety.

Revealing a spry step only known to the Divine in their Age Jinsun,
leaps forward yet again, spinning in a fast circle, and aiming the
tipped blade just for the heel of Dunamis.

Daslin hops lightly, springing over the spear in a bold leap toward the
Mad God. Screaming downward in a swift slice, Plagues Tooth nearly
slices straight through Lord Babel.

Jinsun jerks up the spear into both hands, using the wooden shaft to
block the blow with a deafening crack. Renewed in His vigour, he lunges

23:05:04.68 I 100h 0rage 100m 100e 100w[exE|77] :>-more
[File continued via MORE]
toward Dunamis once again.

Jinsun opens his mouth wide, loosing a castrophony of alien screeches
and whispers escaping in a terrifying boom of laughter. As His ancient
back bends downward, He drives the spear into the ground with both
hands. Suddenly the tip appears to meet the circle, a black wisp of
emptiness rushes to meet it, encasing it as it vanishes from His grasp.

Daslin laughs with a confident jeer as He springs back toward the
Master. Just as His feet leave the ground, the spear reappears,
screeching upward from the circle beneath him. The spear impales him
through the foot, pinning him in place.

Towering above his trapped adversary, Jinsun stretches his hand out
toward Dunamis.

Wrenching his foot from the spear pinning it, Daslin lunges out and
stabs the Master through the abdomen with his blade.

Jinsun draws back to the edge of the circle.

Irreverent One Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, Captain of the Tide says in a delicate
and discerning voice, "A setback, servant of Order, and nothing more."

Kneeling beside the prone figure of Jinsun, Grandue carefully lays an
iron chalice on the ground.

The members of the Consortium continue the ritual, bearing an iron
chalice that was recovered many months before.

The chalice that was once in the possession of Lord Scrag can be
described as [Rough black iron forms the bowl and stem of this heavy
chalice, inky and cold. Eerie reliefs crawl across its sides, depicting
eldritch figures entangled in grotesque and unnatural positions. The lip
and base of the chalice are ornamented with thin strips of pale jade,
the green stone emanating a
faint, hazy shimmer of distortion around the vessel. Smoothly polished,
the iron insides of the bowl are stained darker than the exterior by
countless outpourings of blood.]
---


Approaching carefully, Grandue places the chalice under the wound on
Jinsun's torso.

As the blood passes the rim of the iron chalice, Grandue's face is
illuminated with a bright purple light as the eerie reliefs flare with
hazy animation on the exterior of the chalice.

A near-silent sigh is heard as the last drop of blood falls into the
chalice. Grandue removes the chalice from under the gaping wound.

Careful to not slosh the blood out of the chalice, Grandue approaches
the idol.

Holding the chalice in the air over a grotesque idol, Grandue's lips
move silently and a soft hum can be heard emanating from the cup.

Steam begins to rise from the iron chalice and as Grandue tilts the
vessel forward a deep crimson stream of flowing magma pours from the
chalice, slowly covering the idol in a glowing blanket of molten lava.

The eyes of the idol shine dimly in the reflected light of the lava as
Grandue empties the last of the chalice over it.

A strange tension builds. The pressure weighs down upon you, and even

flow, and pools in front of her.

Leaning over, Ariettie is still twitching and contorting as the dark

Ariettie falls back and stops moving as the black puddle reaches out
like a tendril and pours into the lava-coated idol.
Halfsighted Rotose Lochrann says, "Nayah shalkalasamyat akalantar."

The grotesque idol grins, its macabre expression splitting with the wide
and sinister smile.

Silver sparks dance across the heavens as the dazzling orb of the sun
rushes past Achaea's three rings, the second brilliantly coruscating at
its passing.

Two stubby, roughly shapen arms lift, the hands clasping together in a

prayerful gesture, the sound a thunderclap across the hellscape of the
sundered caldera.

Black droplets cascade from the grotesquerie, the occult sweat of the
ritual effort manifest as the figurine strives to part its hands. Wet
clay shudders as the natural order fights the entropic act.

The very air around you screams in protest as a maelstrom of smog and
flame opens before the idol. With its work completed, the focus ceases
all movement and topples off its jutting perch.

"People! Follow me."

Irreverent One Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, Captain of the Tide smiles impishly and
says in a delicate and discerning voice, "On we go into the new

Kyre flashes Jinsun a joyous smile.

The group followed Reiloch onward [Within a swirling maelstrom of lava.]

It could only be described as [Seething walls of molten lava rise up on
every side, held tenuously at bay only by the arcane power of Ashtan's
ritualists. The crackling fury ascends high overhead, almost obscuring
the open sky far above. Here in the midst of the lava, a thin path of
black stone lies revealed, leading to a small patch of exposed ground on
the bottom the now-volcanic Balaton. In the midst of the exposed area,
an obsidian plinth juts up jaggedly to about waist-height. The air here
ripples with heat and the discomfort of profane magic, alive with the
barely-restrained violence of the great lava waves swirling all around.
A jagged obsidian plinth supports a grim tome, the Key of Iron and
Gold.]

The tome itself was a wonder to behold. [This dread tome sits atop a
plinth of jagged obsidian. Its cover, blackened by flames and occult
magics, bears a series of writhing, intricate symbols that pulse with
ominous power. Its pages, wrought from human skin by some obscene art,
are leathery and ragged, yet somehow they survive untouched by the
furious heat of the book's volcanic surroundings. Black iron chains bind
the book to the obsidian plinth, and it is unclear whether they are
intended to prevent the tome's theft or its escape.

It's very contents attributed to Imperator Glaaki, the Eldritch

The group took their time, reading the tome one after another.

Grandue Bloodthroat, The Archon Ascendant says, "We cannot linger."

Colivar nods his head in agreement.

Preeminent Daslin Esben-Gunnar, Edge of Madness says in a hoarse,
growling voice, "Shall someone snag the journal, then?"

Grandue Bloodthroat, The Archon Ascendant says, "No."

Grandue Bloodthroat, The Archon Ascendant says, "It will remain here."

Irreverent One Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, Captain of the Tide whispers in a
delicate and discerning voice, "Into that glory we shall rise fulfilled,
ascended beyond the bounds of imagination into the eternal Dominion of
Chaos."

Grandue tried to make sense of how to exit this place. It did not take
the group longer to make sense of it.

Grandue Bloodthroat, The Archon Ascendant says, "What would be the
workings of Chaos."

Preeminent Daslin Esben-Gunnar, Edge of Madness says in a hoarse,
growling voice, "To make war."
Daslin disappears in a whirl of midnight-hued smog.

Shara says with a susurrate, imperfect accent, "To enact paradox."
A strange blue hue surrounds you in a thick blanket of smog and you find
yourself standing upon the scorched isle once more.

The corners of Daslin's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
The corners of Jinsun's mouth turn up as he grins mischievously.
Your mouth turns up as your face breaks into a smile.

The three prominent members of the Vanguard in attendance were the first
to answer correctly and make their way back the scored isle on the lava
field. With that accomplished, the ritual and the presentation of our
reward for past deeds was revealed.

Grandue Bloodthroat, The Archon Ascendant says, "Well done, Seat of
Chaos."

You see Irreverent One Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, Captain of the Tide shout,
"What nauseating arrogance! What dreary nonsense! What hopeless gambit!
Did he think to contain the power of Chaos in a prison? Did he think
tobind the very force that undoes all bounds?"

You see Irreverent One Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, Captain of the Tide shout,
"HAIL CHAOS!"

You see Preeminent Daslin Esben-Gunnar, Edge of Madness shout, "Hail

If I may add, Elly came to join the group to witness the Key of Iron and
Gold. At this time, we see the city energised with new passion, young
and old voices coming together for a purpose. Yet, there are those
amongst the group who held back during the ritual. We can only hope
these citizens will do more than watch as we continue towards our goals
realised.
